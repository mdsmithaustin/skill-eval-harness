Skill Eval Harness is a Python CLI that measures the **causal lift** of an Agent Skill: it runs the same case, model, and repetition with and without the skill, validates that exact experimental identity, then reports what changed, what passed, and whether the eval leaked its own answer. It reads `evals/shared-benchmark.json`, emits answer-key-safe task rows, grades files under `eval-runs/` locally and deterministically — no model call in the grade path — and writes benchmark reports you can diff across variants.

General eval frameworks (openai/evals, vitest-evals, viteval) score one output against a rubric. This one measures the *difference the skill makes*, and spends its surface area on keeping that difference honest: paired with/without comparison, `tune`/`holdout`/`holdback` split discipline, leakage lint, materialized ablations with provenance gates, and per-model lift. None of those frameworks have them, and they are what make a reported number trustworthy rather than merely green.

## Questions this helps answer

| Question | Command/report to use |
|---|---|
| Does this skill improve outputs compared with no skill at all? | `prepare` paired `with_skill` / `without_skill` rows, then `benchmark` paired lift and significance. |
| Which prompts improved, regressed, saturated, or showed no lift? | `benchmark` `case_flags`, `render-viewer`, and `error-analysis`. |
| Could this eval have shown the lift I care about? | `benchmark --min-lift`, then the paired lift's `interval` and `noise_check`. |
| Is the skill worth its extra tokens or dollars? | `profile-skill`, `token-overhead`, `cost-summary`, and lift-per-dollar summaries. |
| Did my latest skill edit introduce a regression? | Re-run the same manifest, inspect `ablation_regressions`, `trend`, and `render-viewer --previous-workspace`. |
| Which instruction, checklist, reference, script, or asset is load-bearing? | Materialized `ablation:<id>` arms plus declared `expected_regressions`. |
| Does the agent discover/load the skill when it should, and stay quiet when it should not? | `skill-trigger-matrix` or `skill-pi-trigger-eval`, split by should-fire / should-not-fire cases. |
| Which model tier should this skill target? | `prepare --models`, then `benchmark` `by_model` and `model_analysis`. |
| Is this eval safe to spend model budget on? | `validate --strict-leakage --leakage-min-chars 1 --check-ablations` and `audit-manifest --fail-on-blockers`. |
| Can I trust this LLM judge or rubric result? | `judge`, `compare-judges`, `judge-robustness`, and `judge-alignment`. |
| Could the eval be contaminated by leaked answer keys or memorized canaries? | Prompt leakage lint plus `contamination` over generated outputs. |
| Can this become a CI gate? | `suite-run`, `report --fail-on-failures --format junit|github`, and readiness blockers from `audit-manifest`. |

## Core loop

1. **Describe cases** in `evals/shared-benchmark.json`: prompt, split, fixture files, variants, assertions, and ablations.
2. **Prepare tasks** with `skill-benchmark prepare`; generation rows omit `expected_behavior` and judge rubrics unless you explicitly request them.
3. **Run tasks** with Claude, Codex, Gemini CLI, Mistral Vibe, Jetty, or any runner that writes the run-output contract; Pi support is currently trigger-focused plus workspace-specific smoke tooling.
4. **Grade outputs** with deterministic assertions: string, regex, file, JSON field, and opt-in `script` oracles.
5. **Inspect the report** for pass rates, flaky repeated runs, no-lift cases, saturated assertions, judge tasks, and trigger/no-trigger results.

## What the CLI owns

- Causal lift: exact `(case, model, repetition, population)` `with_skill` vs `without_skill` pairs (plus optional `old_skill` and `ablation:<id>`), with blocked-pair diagnostics, paired significance, and per-model lift.
- Split discipline: `tune`, `holdout`, and `holdback` are explicit filters/report labels. The CLI prevents accidental all-split mixing; private `prompt_ref` storage and when to run hidden splits remain user-owned policy.
- Local grading: deterministic assertions run without model calls.
- Eval hygiene: leakage lint, manifest audit, trigger checks, repeated-run stats, and fixture recommendations.
- Activation: does the skill load on its own? `skill-trigger-matrix` reports autonomous trigger rates per (agent × model), split by should-fire / should-not-fire.
- Cost as a signal: normalized token/dollar telemetry per run, a suite cost ledger, and lift-per-dollar (`cost-summary`, `token-overhead`).
- Interop: Anthropic-style exports, static/served HTML review pages, and Jetty runbook-mode import/export.
- Judge plumbing: `judge`/`rubric` assertions can be exported or run through native Claude/Codex/Gemini/Vibe backends (`--judge-backend`) or a user-supplied `--judge-cmd`; the harness does not choose a model for you.

## Quick start

> Requires Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). This fork is not published to PyPI. Install it from GitHub:
>
> ```bash
> uv tool install git+https://github.com/mdsmithaustin/skill-eval-harness.git@main
> ```
>
> For exact reproducibility, pin a commit: `uv tool install git+https://github.com/mdsmithaustin/skill-eval-harness.git@<commit-sha>`.
> The distribution is named `skill-eval-harness-ext`. The `skill-eval-harness` package on PyPI is the upstream project, not this fork.
>
> Already have a `skill-eval-harness` tool installed? Run `uv tool uninstall skill-eval-harness` first, or the install exits 2. See [Installation](#installation).

Run these from a skill repo that has `evals/shared-benchmark.json`:

```bash
# 1. Check manifest shape and fixture paths.
skill-benchmark validate evals/shared-benchmark.json

# 2. Emit answer-key-safe task rows for a runner.
skill-benchmark prepare evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --split tune \
  --runs-per-variant 3 \
  --out /tmp/tasks.jsonl

# 3. Run each task with your agent runner and save:
# eval-runs/latest/<case_id>/<variant>/run-<n>/output.md
# eval-runs/latest/<case_id>/<variant>/run-<n>/metadata.json

# 4. Grade saved outputs. Add --allow-scripts only if you trust repo-owned oracles.
skill-benchmark benchmark evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs eval-runs/latest \
  --split tune \
  --allow-scripts \
  --out benchmark.json

# 5. Open a static review page.
skill-benchmark render-viewer \
  --benchmark benchmark.json \
  --runs eval-runs/latest \
  --out review.html
```

Expected landmarks:

```text
validate  -> OK: <skill-name> — <case-count> cases, <ablation-count> ablations
prepare   -> /tmp/tasks.jsonl, one JSON object per case/variant/run
benchmark -> benchmark.json with summary, results, and case_flags
viewer    -> review.html with assertion evidence and output previews
```

`benchmark.json` records one row per case/variant/run, plus aggregate pass rates, timing/token summaries, and flags for saturated (both arms always pass), floor (`floor: fails in both arms`), no-lift, flaky, or with-skill-failed cases. It also carries a `reliability` block — unbiased **pass@k** and **pass^k** per (case, variant) from the repeated runs — beside the paired lift's sign-flip `significance`, and a `trajectory_diff` block: per case, over validated experimental pairs, the commands exclusive to one arm across the case's complete repetition set, event-count deltas (steps/commands/tool calls/file reads/file writes), and per-arm skill-load rates — how the arms *behaved*, beside whether they passed. An arm without non-empty, readable trace evidence blocks its pair with a named reason instead of reading as an empty diff.

Each paired lift also carries an `interval` (the sign-flip test inverted into a 95% confidence interval, unbounded below six paired cases; the six-unit bound is the **Inference unit** entry in [`docs/vocabulary.md`](docs/vocabulary.md#report-signals)) and a `noise_check` whose `verdict` names what stops the eval from resolving a lift: too few cases moved, a noise floor above the `without_skill` headroom, or one above the `--min-lift` you would act on. A `run_endings` block counts, per variant, how runs stopped, whether the served model matched the request, and the effort each ran at, so a refusal is not read as a capability miss. The fields are in [`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md#lift-interval-and-noise-check).

## Installation

### From GitHub

The fork publishes no PyPI package. Install a commit or branch from its git URL.

If `uv tool list` already shows `skill-eval-harness`, remove it first. That covers the upstream PyPI package, an install from this fork before the rename, and an editable install. Both distributions provide the same scripts, so `uv tool install` exits 2 with `Executables already exist` while the old tool is present. Do not use `--force`: it leaves both tools registered, and a later `uv tool uninstall skill-eval-harness` deletes the new tool's executables.

```bash
uv tool uninstall skill-eval-harness   # skip when it is not installed
uv tool install git+https://github.com/mdsmithaustin/skill-eval-harness.git@main
skill-benchmark --help
skill-pi-trigger-eval --help

# Pin a commit exactly:
uv tool install git+https://github.com/mdsmithaustin/skill-eval-harness.git@<commit-sha>

# One-shot without installing globally:
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mdsmithaustin/skill-eval-harness.git@main skill-benchmark --help
```

The distribution name is `skill-eval-harness-ext`, so `importlib.metadata.version("skill-eval-harness-ext")` reads its version. Module names and console scripts keep their names.

Upgrading a saved run tree requires more than changing the pin. Follow the
relevant release boundary in [`docs/upgrading.md`](docs/upgrading.md) before regenerating
reports; manifest migration and telemetry migration are separate commands.

The installed commands are:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-benchmark` | Validate manifests, prepare tasks, grade outputs, compare variants, run judges, and import/export runner formats. |
| `skill-pi-trigger-eval` | Runs Pi without forced `--skill` and checks whether the model loads the skill from stream events. |
| `skill-trigger-matrix` | Measures autonomous skill activation per (agent, model) cell — Claude, Codex, Pi, Vibe, and an offline stub are built in; additional agents add an adapter implementation and one unified backend-registry row. |

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdsmithaustin/skill-eval-harness.git
cd skill-eval-harness
uv tool uninstall skill-eval-harness   # skip when it is not installed
uv tool install --editable .
skill-benchmark --help
```

## Documentation map

Everything under `docs/` is indexed once, in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md): user journeys (each titled by the question it answers), concepts, the command reference, specs, and audits, with the convention for adding a user-journey walkthrough. The table below covers the files outside `docs/`.

| File | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Manifest shape, run layout, and the command index. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release history and unreleased repo-surface changes. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Local setup, validation commands, and eval-safety rules. |
| `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` | Design lessons from the multi-skill saturation work and the roadmap/cost build-out. |
| `TODO.md` | Status tracker: the eval-framework roadmap, remaining Jetty work, Gemini's explicitly gated autonomous-trigger follow-up, the `swap:<id>` ablation follow-on, and migration/user-journey documentation. |
| `examples/demo-skill/` | Self-contained, **offline** end-to-end example: a tiny synthetic skill, two answer-path materialized ablations, one discovery ablation for trigger examples, and a deterministic stub runner (no model/API). `prepare → run-codex → judge → benchmark` confirms a regression per answer-path ablation; exercised by `tests/test_example_demo.py`. The [trajectory journey](docs/did-my-skill-change-how-the-model-works.md) grades the path, and the [discovery journey](docs/did-removing-this-break-discovery.md) compares a discovery ablation. Also carries should-fire/should-not-fire trigger cases for `skill-trigger-matrix` (offline via `--agent stub`; live smoke via `RUN_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1`). Start here. |
| `examples/skill-pins.json` | Exact commit SHAs and canonical tree hashes for the ten skills in [`docs/ablation-study-walkthrough.md`](docs/ablation-study-walkthrough.md), so that study reproduces without vendoring any skill content. |
| `examples/edited-file-demo/` | Offline product-edit example with committed patch replay and trusted tests. Its README also documents the opt-in Codex permission smoke. |
| `examples/adewale-workspace/` | Adewale-specific Pi smoke runner and cross-repo aggregate report (the trigger runners are the top-level `skill-pi-trigger-eval` and `skill-trigger-matrix`). |
| `scripts/smoke_supported_clis.py` | Opt-in, low-cost smoke across native Claude/Codex/Gemini/Vibe answer paths and Pi trigger path using a disposable demo-skill eval. Add `--permission-edit --agents codex` to verify a captured edit and native test-command success. |
| `scripts/record_claude_stream.py` | Records one redacted `claude -p --output-format stream-json` stream, with its provenance, into `tests/fixtures/claude/` for the parser tests; spends one real model call. |
| `tests/test_skill_benchmark.py` | Executable examples for grading, leakage lint, script assertions, judge commands, Jetty export/import, trace artifacts, and trigger detection. |

## Manifest format

Each skill repo owns a `shared-benchmark.json` manifest in one of two places. The first is `evals/shared-benchmark.json`, at the repo root or inside a skill directory as `skills/<name>/evals/shared-benchmark.json`. The second is `evals/<name>/shared-benchmark.json`, one directory per skill at the repo root. The second layout exists because a skill installer such as `npx skills` copies a skill directory verbatim, so a manifest under `skills/<name>/evals/` ships fixtures, prompts, and oracles to everyone who installs the skill. `evals/<name>/shared-benchmark.json` keeps those files out of the published directory while `"skill_paths": ["skills/<name>/SKILL.md"]` still resolves. Add a `harness` block so readers know which external harness/version to install.

`skill_paths` (and `old_skill_paths`, ablation `target.skill_root`) resolve from the repository root for a file named `evals/shared-benchmark.json` or `evals/<skill>/shared-benchmark.json`. Other manifest files, including YAML, resolve them from their own directory. `validate`, `prepare` and `audit-manifest` fail when a skill path is missing or escapes that root, and name the rule that applied.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "skill_name": "good-pr",
  "harness": {
    "name": "skill-eval-harness-ext",
    "url": "https://github.com/mdsmithaustin/skill-eval-harness",

        {"name": "qualitative-review", "type": "judge", "rubric": ["Specific", "maintainer-friendly"]}
      ],
      "tags": ["security", "testing"]
    }
  ],
  "ablations": [
    {
      "id": "no-regression-proof",
      "removed_component": "regression-proof requirement",
      "expected_regressions": ["Accepts weak tests that still pass without the fix"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Splits

| Split | Purpose | Prompt storage |
|---|---|---|
| `tune` | Visible cases used while editing the skill and evals. | Inline `prompt` is fine. |
| `holdout` | Hidden cases scored at end-of-round or merge. | Prefer private `prompt_ref`. |
| `holdback` | Not shown in skill/docs/evals until after scoring; detects memorization. | Prefer private `prompt_ref` and ignored answer keys. |

`prepare` fails on missing hidden prompts unless `--allow-missing-prompts` is used for dry-run planning.

Use optional `files` for fixture-backed evals. Paths are relative to the manifest's own directory, validated by `validate`, and emitted by `prepare` as absolute `input_files` for the runner. `prompt_ref` and script-oracle commands resolve against that same directory, never against the repo root. Under the `evals/<name>/` layout the manifest's own directory is `evals/<name>/`, so a fixture, a private prompt, or an oracle script lives under `evals/<name>/` and moves with the manifest rather than staying beside the skill.

`skill_paths` entries are relative to the repo root (`<base>` for a manifest at `<base>/evals/shared-benchmark.json` or `<base>/evals/<name>/shared-benchmark.json`, otherwise the manifest's own directory) and name either a `SKILL.md` or the skill directory that holds one. Every built tree — the canonical `with_skill` tree, each materialized ablation, an answer runner's workspace, and the skills directory a trigger adapter mounts — places a root under its own skill directory name, which is what Agent Skills discovery expects: `skills/good-pr/SKILL.md` and `skills/good-pr` both mount as `good-pr`. A per-skill manifest at `<skill>/evals/shared-benchmark.json` declares `"skill_paths": ["SKILL.md"]`; that skill directory is the repo root, so its mount name is the frontmatter `name`, never the checkout's directory name. Two roots that would mount under the same name are rejected.

Further optional manifest surfaces (each with a behavior-preserving default; see `docs/migrating-evals.md`):

- `version`: 1 or 2 — `skill-benchmark migrate` upgrades 1 → 2 by stamping the defaults explicitly.
- `judge`: `{"model": "..."}` — the default judge model for the `judge` command; `audit-manifest` flags `judge-is-model-under-test` (fatal under `--strict-judge`).
- `datasets` + a case `template`: fan one case template over rows with `{key}` placeholder filling and stable ids (`<case>-<row id|index>`); leakage lint runs per materialized case.
- `turns` on a case: a scripted multi-turn sequence; each turn's assertions grade that turn's transcript entry (`turn-<n>/output.md`), case-level assertions grade the final answer.
- YAML manifests: a `.yaml` manifest (plus `dataset_files` mapping dataset ids to JSONL row files) compiles to the same shape in memory — validation, lint, and grading are identical.
- Reference floors: `reference_score` (0-1) / `reference_graded_score` (1-5).
- `source` on a case: where it came from (`production`, `bug-report`, `hand-written`, `synthesized`, or `imported`); `audit-manifest` counts the sources and flags a suite that records none or only synthesized cases.
- A known answer on a case: `reference_answer` (inline, tune cases only) or `reference_answer_ref` (a manifest-relative file, the form `holdout` and `holdback` cases must use). The two are mutually exclusive and not allowed on trigger cases. Only `audit-manifest`'s known-answer check reads it, and prepared tasks never carry it.

## Assertions

Objective assertion types:

| Type | Checks |
|---|---|
| `contains` | One substring is present. |
| `contains_any` | At least one substring is present. |
| `contains_all` | Every listed substring is present. |
| `excludes_any` | No listed substring is present. |
| `regex` | Regex matches output. |
| `not_regex` | Regex does not match output. |
| `file_exists` | A file exists relative to the run directory. |
| `json_field_equals` | A JSON field equals an expected value. |
| `golden_output` | Output (or a named artifact) equals a reference file; explicit normalization (`exact` default, `trim`, `text`); unified diff as failure evidence. |
| `similarity` | difflib ratio against an `expected` string with a `threshold` (default 0.8), emitting a score. `mode: "embedding"` uses cosine similarity behind the opt-in `--embed-cmd`. |
| `structured_output` | JSON (an artifact via `path`, or extracted from the output) validates against a deterministic JSON-Schema subset (`type`/`properties`/`required`/`items`/`enum`/`const`/`minItems`/`maxItems`). |
| `script` | Opt-in deterministic oracle command against the output directory. A stdout line like `{"score": 6, "max_score": 7}` feeds the graded channel; exit code still decides pass/fail. |
| `skill_invoked` | Trace/process check that the runner loaded the skill, or did not, as expected. |
| `command_ran` / `command_not_ran` | Trace/process checks over normalized command events. |
| `command_order` | Trace/process check that commands appeared in a required order. |
| `tool_call` | A tool call matching `tool`/`pattern` occurred (with `min_count`/`max_count` bounds), or an ordered `order` list of calls. BFCL-style set relations over completed-call **tool names** (exact, case-insensitive — *not* substring): `expected_no_call` (the named tool, or any name matching `pattern`, must never have been observed—even as started, failed, or in progress), `required_calls` (an order-independent subset of completed tool names that must all appear, extras allowed), `call_set` (an exact multiset of completed tool names—same names and multiplicities, no unexpected named calls). Use `pattern`/`order`/`command_ran` for regex or command-text matching. Positive selectors match completed call inputs, never outputs. |
| `tool_sequence` | The completed trajectory (commands, tool calls, file reads/writes, skill loads — each keyed by its normalized casefolded name, a nameless shell command as `bash`) against a manifest `expected` list, under `mode`: `strict` (exact order and length, default), `unordered` (same multiset, order-free), `subset` (`actual` ⊆ `expected` as multisets — every completed call was on the list, some listed steps may have been skipped; an empty completed trajectory always satisfies this), `superset` (`actual` ⊇ `expected` as multisets — every expected call ran, extra steps allowed). The subject is always the *actual* trajectory, matching jevals/LangChain agentevals naming — see `docs/authoring-evals.md` for the full rule and a per-provider key table, since `expected` is written against one provider's tool-name vocabulary, not a shared one. Always reports `precision`/`recall`/`f1` (multiset overlap) in its evidence and as `score`; an optional `min_f1` additionally gates `passed`. Missing `events.json` fails closed (`unavailable`), never passes. |
| `tool_count_le` / `no_repeated_command_loop` | Trace/process budgets for tool use and thrashing. |
| `total_tokens_le` / `elapsed_seconds_le` / `command_count_le` | Efficiency checks over `metrics.json`, `metadata.json`, or normalized events. |

Assertion objects are closed contracts, including nested `graded_dimensions` and
`dynamic_rubric` objects: unknown fields and fields that do not apply to the selected assertion
type are validation errors, so a misspelled severity or path cannot silently change the grader.
A `golden_output` reference must already be a regular file. A local script oracle must live in a
dedicated subdirectory (for example `oracles/check.py`); the harness binds that oracle tree into
the eval-contract digest and rejects symlinks. Changing an imported helper or data file therefore
invalidates stale prepared runs, while generated files beside the manifest cannot make the
contract self-referential.

Human-readable answer assertions (`contains`, `contains_any`, `contains_all`,
`excludes_any`, `regex`, `not_regex`, and `similarity`) compare through the
versioned `rendered-v1` view by default. The raw `output.md` is never rewritten:
the comparison view applies NFC canonical normalization and removes only a
narrow allow-list of zero-width, non-ordering controls: `U+200B ZERO WIDTH
SPACE`, `U+2060 WORD JOINER`, and `U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`. Controls
that can change visible glyph order (including bidi overrides/isolates) and
`U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN` remain exact. Case-insensitive literal and ratio comparisons
use Unicode case-folding.
Results record `comparison: "rendered-v1"`; when normalization changes the input
they also record the affected code points and, for deterministic matchers,
whether it changed the verdict. Embedding similarity records that field as
`null` because determining the raw verdict would require a second external
embedding call. Similarity scores are rounded to four decimals before either
`threshold` or `atLeast` derives the verdict, so a published score cannot
contradict `passed`. Embedding vectors must contain finite, non-boolean numbers;
negative cosine values map to the 0.0 floor of the public 0-1 score domain. Use
`"comparison": "exact"` when an assertion deliberately tests formatting
characters (and `"ci": false` when case must also remain exact). A rendered operand may not become empty, and regex
source must already be NFC/control-stable so normalization cannot create an
empty regex branch. Every `rendered-v1` regex verdict uses exact-pinned
`regex==2026.7.19` in `VERSION0` compatibility mode under a 0.25-second native
operation deadline; inserting a removable control therefore cannot switch regex
engines or Unicode character-class semantics. When normalization changes the
candidate, its normalized verdict and optional raw diagnostic share that deadline.
Timeout or resource exhaustion produces partial/unavailable evidence rather
than a positive or negative verdict. This path is in-process, works in worker
threads, and owns no process signal or timer. Because that engine targets
CPython for non-ASCII text, `rendered-v1` regex evaluation is unavailable on
PyPy; `comparison: "exact"` retains the existing stdlib `re` behavior.
Negative assertions use the same view, so invisible
characters cannot hide banned content. `golden_output`, structured JSON,
scripts, commands, tool names, and paths retain their exact/protocol semantics.

Every assertion may declare a **severity** — `critical` (an absorbing barrier: one failure vetoes the run, every rate collapses to 0.0 and the graded score is withheld), `gate` (lowers the pass rate; the default for objective types), or `soft` (feeds only the graded score channel — a soft failure never moves the objective, qualitative, or combined pass rates; the default for judge/similarity). Declare `severity: "gate"` on a judge assertion to keep it in the qualitative/combined rate. `--strict`, one of the [grading options](docs/commands.md#grading-options) every grading command takes, promotes soft to gate. An `atLeast` floor on a plain scored judge requires a normalized 0–1 score and decides its pass; on `graded_dimensions` it tightens the normalized form of the dimension threshold. Missing score evidence remains unavailable rather than becoming a failure. Dynamic and per-step judges use `minimum_criteria` and `min_met_fraction` respectively instead of `atLeast`. Every assertion may also declare an **oracle tier** — `strong` (deterministic, the default for text/process/efficiency), `demo` (the default for `script`), or `live` (judge) — reported per case as `oracle_strength` and audited (`weak-oracle-only`).

Use `script` when a keyword check is too weak for the property you care about. The command sees the candidate run directory, so it can inspect `output.md`, generated files under `outputs/`, or metadata. Script assertions are blocked unless you pass `--allow-scripts` to a command that grades ([grading options](docs/commands.md#grading-options)):

```json
{
  "name": "oracle-pass",
  "type": "script",
  "command": ["python3", "oracles/oracle.py", "{output_dir}"],
  "pass_exit_code": 0,
  "timeout_s": 30
}
```

`command` runs with cwd set to the manifest directory. `{output_dir}` is replaced with the absolute run directory. The assertion passes when the command exits with `pass_exit_code` (default `0`); stdout and stderr are stored as evidence.

Trace/process/efficiency assertions are optional and fail closed when declared evidence is missing. For example, `command_not_ran` cannot pass without `events.json`, and `total_tokens_le` cannot pass without token telemetry.

Assertions can be scoped to variants when the expected process differs by arm:

```json
{"name":"with-skill-loaded","type":"skill_invoked","expected":true,"variants":["with_skill"]}
{"name":"without-skill-clean","type":"skill_invoked","expected":false,"variants":["without_skill"]}
```

Use this for process checks such as `skill_invoked`; otherwise a with-skill requirement would incorrectly penalize the no-skill baseline.

Qualitative assertion types:

| Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `judge` | Deferred as a keyed judge task; `grade --judge-tasks` can serialize the queue, and `--judge-results` merges verdicts. |
| `rubric` | Same deferred, keyed qualitative flow. |
| `factuality` | Preset: a judge assertion carrying a canned anchored factuality rubric scored 1–5 (threshold 4). `preset: "factuality"` on a judge assertion does the same; add `score_scale: [1, 5]` to feed its score to the graded channel. |

A plain judge that scores on its own scale declares it as `score_scale: [low, high]` (for example `[1, 5]`, with `threshold` on that scale): it must return a `score` in range, passes when the raw score reaches `threshold`, and feeds the graded channel `(score - low) / (high - low)`. A judge assertion may carry **anchored graded dimensions** (`graded_dimensions: [{name, scale: "1-5", rubric: "5 = …observable…; 1 = …"}]` — the judge returns `dimension_scores`, normalized to 0-1, passing at `threshold` ≥ 4 by default), a **dynamic rubric** (`dynamic_rubric: {instruction, minimum_criteria}` — the judge drafts case-specific criteria and must meet the minimum), or a **per-step trajectory rubric** (`per_step: true`, or `per_step: {min_met_fraction: f}`). A per-step judge grades EACH completed trajectory step — one criterion per step, named step-1..step-N in trajectory order, with the untruncated invocation and result records resolved separately from `trace.jsonl` beside the normalized summaries — and passes when at least `ceil(f × steps)` steps are judged sound (default: every step). It is trace-evidence-backed and fails closed like a process assertion: a run with no completed steps fails the assertion at grade time and no judge task (no model spend) is emitted. Stored verdicts carry a hash of the exact step payload and are re-queued if the trajectory, criterion names, or derived minimum changes. Per-step assertions are case-level only; turn assertions do not have independent trace artifacts. A case may set a reference floor (`reference_score` 0-1 or `reference_graded_score` 1-5); scoring below it flags `below-reference-floor`. Paired reports carry a sign-flip permutation `significance` block and the `interval` that inverts it beside every lift, and a `graded` channel (with its own `interval`) when graded scores exist.

Judge results are keyed by `judge_task_id`:

```json
{"judge_task_id":"case::with_skill::run-1::qualitative-review","passed":true,"score":4,"evidence":"Specific evidence from output"}
```

## Run output contract

The harness grades either the legacy layout:

```text
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/output.md
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/metadata.json
```

or repeated/artifact layout:

```text
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/output.md
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/metadata.json
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-2/outputs/<artifact files>
```

Trace-aware runners may also write:

```text
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/trace.jsonl       # raw runner event stream
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/events.json       # normalized events used by process assertions
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/metrics.json      # tokens, commands, tool calls, elapsed time, retries where observed
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/environment.json  # runner/model/sandbox details where available
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/artifact-commit.json # required-file SHA-256 inventory, written last by current runners
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/workspace-changes.json  # what the model added, modified, or deleted in its workspace
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/candidate.patch         # text edits as one git patch, only when there are any
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/run-1/candidate-files/<sha256> # content copies the patch cannot carry
runs/answer-design.json                          # exact expected answer experiment and eval-contract digest
runs/spend/<invocation-id>/spend-ceiling.json     # runtime admission ledger when a native answer or subagent ceiling is set
```

Prepared `run-agent` rows can optionally carry a fixed [recovery case](docs/recovery.md).
Those rows retain one fixture across an intentional checkpoint stop, fresh recovery, and fresh refusal.
They write `recovery.json` and raw process evidence rather than an ordinary answer grade.
Completed phases establish runner capability, not provider eligibility or permission enforcement.

`run-agent`, `run-codex`, `run-claude`, and `run-subagent` accept `--max-cost-usd` and `--assumed-cost-per-run-usd` for a per-invocation admission ceiling. A zero ceiling starts no calls. Missing prices close later admission unless an explicit assumption applies. Capped batches reject every recovery row before any run starts. See [the native spend walkthrough](docs/limit-native-spend.md) for offline examples, refusal records, and report references. Subagent admission prices each external callback turn. A refused conversation root is incomplete. An invocation that starts no turn preserves any prior destination content.

Ordinary answer runners (`run-agent`, `run-codex`, `run-claude`) and `run-subagent` run the model in a
temporary workspace and delete it afterwards. Before deletion they diff it against a copy taken
right after the harness built it, for every outcome including a timeout, so partial edits from a
killed run are kept. `workspace-changes.json` lists each changed path with its before and after state
(`file` with `sha256`, `size`, `text`, and `executable`; `symlink` with its target, never
followed; `special`; or `unreadable`, a file the capture could not read or a directory it could
not list, with its `mode`) and where its content lives:

- `patch`: a hunk in `candidate.patch`, which `git apply` replays onto the baseline, executable
  bit included. A chmod-only change to a patch-eligible text file is a patch entry with only
  `old mode`/`new mode` lines; other files follow the `blob` and `omitted` rules below. The manifest records the patch as `{"path": "candidate.patch", "sha256": ...}`.
- `blob`: `candidate-files/<sha256>`, used for binary or non-UTF-8 content, for paths git would
  have to quote, and for a modified text file whose before side exceeds 1 MiB (the after bytes
  are copied). For a deletion the blob holds the bytes before it.
- `state`: a symlink or special file, fully described by its states.
- `omitted`: `oversize` past 1 MiB, `total_cap` past 32 MiB per run, or `unreadable`.

An unreadable path costs one entry, not the whole capture: the rest of the workspace is still
recorded. The capture does not look inside an unreadable directory, so baseline files under it are
not listed as deleted, and the directory itself appears as an `added` entry because the baseline
records no directories. Copies are named by digest, so a model file called `metadata.json` never
appears under that name in the run directory.

An answer cites workspace files by absolute path, for example `/tmp/codex-ws-k3q/x.toml`. To
find its entry, strip the manifest's `workspace_root` or `workspace_root_realpath` prefix (on
macOS, `/tmp` and `/var/folders` resolve under `/private`) and look up the rest in
`changes[].path`. Like git, the capture records files, not directories, so an empty directory
never appears (an unreadable directory is the one exception). A path absent from `changes` was unchanged, outside the workspace, or an empty
directory.

Readers report `workspace_changes_captured` and `workspace_changes_state` next to
`artifact_set_complete`. `captured` means the artifact set is complete, nothing was omitted,
`candidate.patch` is in the commit inventory under the digest the manifest records, and every blob
is there under its own digest; zero changes counts. `partial` means some content was omitted,
`failed` means the capture itself failed (`capture_error` says at which stage), and `invalid` means the manifest or
its referenced files do not check out. Runs without a manifest (legacy runs, Jetty) get neither
key. The claim does not affect scoring or `execution_valid`. Codex answer runs default to
`--sandbox read-only`, so they record an empty, captured change set unless `--codex-cmd` relaxes
the sandbox.

`trace.jsonl` is the agent CLI's own stream, preserved verbatim, and it is read with the
stream rule: a line that repeats an object key (`codex exec --json` repeats `id` on some
event lines) is kept with the last value winning, the same rule as Python's `json.loads`,
and the row's `metrics.json` (or a trigger row's metadata) lists what was kept under
`stream_duplicate_keys` as `line N: key`. A line that is not JSON is still skipped and
counted in `parse_errors`. Everything the harness authors or validates (manifests,
prepared tasks, `events.json`, `metrics.json`, `metadata.json`, judge rows, reports, the
Codex session rollout) is read with the strict rule, where a repeated key is rejected.

Current ordinary answer and Jetty writers record independent process, provider-response, trace,
and artifact-set evidence. Tool/command/file/retry/skill measurements are available only
when the first three channels are complete; readers derive artifact completeness by
verifying `artifact-commit.json`. Legacy directories without a marker remain readable but
cannot acquire committed-artifact provenance. Current runners also attest ordinary answer runs to
`answer-design.json`; reports with missing, extra, duplicated, or stale task identities remain
partial and expose any surviving calculations only under explicitly labelled observed fields.
Recovery rows use [raw phase evidence](docs/recovery.md#run-artifacts) instead of this artifact-marker and answer-report contract.

`metadata.json` is optional, but include what your runner can capture:

```json
{
  "elapsed_ms": 12345,
  "input_tokens": 1000,
  "output_tokens": 500,
  "total_tokens": 1500,
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
}
```

For ordinary answer rows, the native runners also record how each run ended: `stop_class` beside the raw `stop_reason` and its `stop_source`; `requested_model`, `served_model`, `served_models`, and `served_model_check`; and `effort`, which is `{"requested": null, "applied_by": "backend_default"}` unless `--effort` pinned it. A `truncated` or `turn_limit` stop, or a served-model `mismatch`, makes the run unscorable and blocks its pair; a refusal stays graded. The values are defined in [`docs/vocabulary.md`](docs/vocabulary.md#run-artifacts). A custom runner may write the same fields. Which backends observe what is in [`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md#effort-and-how-answer-runs-ended). Recovery rows retain [requested settings and phase observations](docs/recovery.md#run-artifacts), with unknown runtime facts left unknown.

## Ablations

Ablations are opt-in variants that remove part of a skill — by simulation, or by materializing a real altered skill (below). Add entries under `manifest.ablations`, then prepare with `--include-ablations`.

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --split tune \
  --include-ablations \
  --ablation-dir ablated-skills \
  --out ablation-tasks.jsonl
```

Ablation task variants are named `ablation:<id>`. Routing is by case population: **answer-population** ablations (instructions/resource/runtime/preprocess) run on non-trigger cases through the generic runners. **Discovery-population** ablations (e.g. a weakened `description`/`when_to_use`) measure whether the skill still *autonomously loads*, which the forced-load generic runners cannot observe — so `prepare` does **not** emit rows for them; run them through `run_pi_trigger_eval.py --ablation <id>` instead.

### Materialized ablations

By default an ablation is *instruction-simulated*: the runner is told to ignore a component. To produce a real, altered skill instead, declare a removal `mechanism` (or a `components` list) and `target` on the ablation, then materialize the trees:

```bash
skill-benchmark materialize-ablations ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --out-dir ablated --out ablated/provenance.json
```

Each declared ablation is written to `ablated/<id>/` as a complete altered skill tree (every manifest root, identical surface to `with_skill`, differing only by the declared edit). Mechanisms are `frontmatter_field`, `section` (fence-aware), `list_item`, deletion-only `patch`, `reference` (pointer/content/both), `script`, `asset`, and `preprocess` (inline `` !`command` ``), composable across multiple components. Ablation is removal-only — replacement/substitution is the separate `swap:<id>` feature tracked in `TODO.md`. Materialized arms are blind: the model-visible input is identical to `with_skill` (the hypothesis lives only in harness metadata).

The materialized tree flows through the runners: the Pi smoke runner mounts it (answer-population only), the autonomous-trigger runners (`skill-trigger-matrix --ablation <id>` with any registered adapter, or `run_pi_trigger_eval.py --ablation <id>`) trigger-test a discovery (e.g. weakened-description) skill, and `export-jetty --include-ablations --ablation-dir DIR` uploads it recursively. A discovery ablation graduates from raw measurement to a causal evidence class through `skill-benchmark trigger-compare`, which pairs the baseline and `--ablation` matrix reports of the same revision under the same provenance/coverage/significance gate the answer path uses. `prepare`/`export-jetty` emit only **answer-population** ablation rows (on non-trigger cases); discovery ablations are measured by the autonomous-trigger runners. The benchmark report's `ablation_regressions` block separates an aggregate "score regressed" from an assertion-level "expected regression confirmed", and only confirms when recorded provenance proves both arms ran the same skill revision **and** the replicated regression clears a significance test (a two-sided paired sign-flip test run **per (case, model)** over exact repetition-level deltas; a regression is significant iff at least one confirmed cohort clears p≤0.05). A cohort with fewer than **6 matched pairs** can never reach significance and is reported `INDETERMINATE`, never confirmed ([inference unit](docs/vocabulary.md#report-signals)). See [`docs/skill-ablation-spec.md`](docs/skill-ablation-spec.md) for the mechanism table, the component-class model, and the correctness gates.

**Evidence paths (discovery vs answer).** A single runner report and a paired comparison have deliberately different evidentiary strength:

- **Answer-population** ablations get *confirmed* causal evidence: a provenance-gated, paired with_skill-vs-ablation comparison where a confirmation requires verified provenance and a same-revision canonical hash on both arms.
- **Discovery** runners emit a **raw autonomous-trigger measurement for one arm** (`evidence_class: raw_autonomous_trigger_measurement`). Each report records its declared agent/model/query design and every `(query_id, run_number)` repetition; `skill_tree_hash` names the bytes actually mounted (canonical in the baseline arm, edited in the ablation arm), while ablation provenance records the canonical parent. `skill-benchmark trigger-compare` validates exact cardinality, rejects duplicates and missing cells, verifies same-revision provenance, and only then computes a causal verdict. Until two reports pass that gate, **read a trigger pass-rate as a measurement, not a confirmed ablation effect.**

## Commands

Full per-command detail — flags, examples, output shapes — lives in
[`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md). This is the index; the [core loop](#core-loop)
above is the five commands you need first (`validate`, `prepare`, `benchmark`,
`render-viewer`, and a runner).

**Core loop**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-benchmark agent-capabilities` | List the unified backend registry, capability gates, trace dialect, smoke policy, and answer/trigger/judge surfaces as JSON. |
| `skill-benchmark validate` | Check manifest shape, fixture paths, regex, oracle paths, and prompt-leakage. |
| `skill-benchmark prepare` | Emit answer-key-safe task rows per case/variant/run (`--include-ablations` materializes ablated trees). |
| `skill-benchmark materialize-ablations` | Write the declared ablated skill trees to disk without preparing tasks — inspect or diff an ablation before spending a run on it. |
| `skill-benchmark grade` | Score saved outputs into per-run rows; emit pending judge tasks. |
| `skill-benchmark benchmark` | Aggregate into variant summaries, paired lift + significance + `interval` + `noise_check` (`--min-lift`), by-model, cost, `run_endings`, and case flags. |
| `skill-benchmark render-viewer` | Static or `--serve`d review page with embedded artifacts and iteration diffs; served mode stores pass/fail/unsure verdicts and notes in `feedback.json`. |

**Runners** (every one but `import-trace` calls a model; so do `judge` and `judge-robustness` below)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-benchmark run-codex` | Drive prepared rows through isolated `codex exec --json --output-last-message`; save trace, events, metrics, answer. `--effort` sets `model_reasoning_effort`. |
| `skill-benchmark run-claude` | Drive `claude -p --output-format stream-json`, capturing real per-run cost + token usage AND the full tool-use stream as the run's trace (`trace.jsonl`/`events.json`), so process assertions have evidence on Claude answer runs. Records the stop reason and served model; `--effort` passes `claude --effort`. |
| `skill-benchmark run-agent` | Provider-neutral native runner over registered backends (`--agent claude`, `--agent codex`, `--agent gemini`, or `--agent vibe`); compatibility wrappers delegate here. `--effort` is refused for Gemini and Vibe, and for a level the backend's CLI does not accept (`minimal` on Claude). |
| `skill-benchmark run-subagent` | In-process backend seam: any provider via `--agent-cmd`, tool replay, multi-turn `turns`. |
| `skill-benchmark import-trace` | Normalize a raw JSONL trace into `events.json`/`metrics.json` for process/efficiency checks. |

**Measurement trust** (model-free unless noted)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-benchmark audit-manifest` | Readiness verdict + blockers, the known-answer check, and eval health over five marks; `--fail-on-blockers` or `--fail-on KINDS` gates CI. |
| `skill-benchmark report` | Serialize `benchmark.json` as JUnit XML or GitHub job-summary + annotations. Add `--fail-on-failures` to require complete evidence and passing `with_skill` checks. Repeat `--gate-variant` to select other arms. |
| `skill-benchmark contamination` | Output-side perimeter: canary tripwire, output↔answer n-gram overlap, released-at/cutoff gate. |
| `skill-benchmark error-analysis` | Open-coding review queue + axial failure taxonomy over a `benchmark.json`; `--feedback feedback.json` fills each row's note from the served review. |
| `skill-benchmark compare-judges` | Flag whether measured lift depends on which judge model graded. |
| `skill-benchmark judge-alignment` | Score a judge against human labels (`--labels feedback.json`, or a legacy labels file): agreement, Cohen's kappa, precision/recall/F1, and score calibration (Brier, ECE, AUROC, threshold sweep). |
| `skill-benchmark judge-robustness` | Order-flip self-consistency + negative controls a robust judge must reject (opt-in, model-touching). |
| `skill-benchmark judge` | Run deferred `judge`/`rubric` assertions through `--judge-backend`/`--judge-model` or `--judge-cmd` (model-touching). |

**Cost and size**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-benchmark cost-summary` | Suite cost ledger: complete/partial/unavailable totals, coverage, by variant/case/runner, top spenders, cost-quality findings. |
| `skill-benchmark migrate-telemetry` | Dry-run or atomically upgrade saved run artifacts to the availability-aware telemetry v3 envelope. |
| `skill-benchmark token-overhead` | Static footprint vs. runtime lift-per-token and lift-per-dollar, with blocked reasons for incompatible pairs. |
| `skill-benchmark profile-skill` | `SKILL.md`/reference token counts, module counts, oversize warnings (static, offline). |

**Scale, trend, iteration**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-benchmark suite-run` | Allowlisted multi-skill preflight/tier with cost ceilings; writes `RUN_SCOPE.json`. |
| `skill-benchmark aggregate` | Cross-skill report over many manifests. |
| `skill-benchmark trend` | Append-only history: series, diffs, prevalence×severity failure ranking, prune candidates. |
| `skill-benchmark suggest-cases` | Turn saturated/no-lift flags into harder-case seeds, never from a floor case (generation opt-in, never edits a manifest). |
| `skill-benchmark migrate` | Upgrade a v1 manifest to v2: stamp severity/oracle tiers, print the judgment-call checklist. |

**Interop and export**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-benchmark export-anthropic` | Emit an Anthropic-skill-creator-compatible `benchmark.json`. |
| `skill-benchmark compare-tasks` / `skill-benchmark compare-results` | Blind A/B comparison export and scoring. |
| `skill-benchmark export-jetty` / `skill-benchmark run-jetty` / `skill-benchmark import-jetty-results` | Jetty runbook-mode export, execute, and import (optional; see the [Jetty adapter](docs/commands.md#jetty-adapter)). |

**Activation** (separate entry points — does the skill load on its own?)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill-trigger-matrix` | Autonomous trigger rate per (agent × model), split by should-fire / should-not-fire. |
| `skill-pi-trigger-eval` | `skill-trigger-matrix --agent pi` under its own name, kept for existing scripts. |
| `skill-benchmark trigger-compare` | Pair baseline and `--ablation` trigger reports of the same skill revision: declared-cell/repetition completeness, duplicate rejection, agent/model cells collapsed by stable authored-query ID, direction-aware sign-flip significance, and a causal-confirmation evidence class. |

## Compatibility notes

- **Anthropic skill-creator**: use `grade --write-grading-files` and `export-anthropic` for compatible `grading.json`/`benchmark.json` shapes.
- **Pi**: use `examples/adewale-workspace/run_pi_smoke.py` for the Adewale multi-repo smoke workflow and `skill-pi-trigger-eval` for autonomous trigger checks.
- **Gemini CLI**: use `run-agent --agent gemini` and `judge --judge-backend gemini`. Each call gets an isolated `GEMINI_CLI_HOME`, requests disabled provider usage statistics, accepts external CLI duplicate keys with last-value-wins handling, keeps finite typed provider contracts and harness artifacts strict, and installs a deny-by-default policy (read-only allowlist for answers, no tools for judges). Nested sandboxing is requested only when a supported host engine exists and the selected credential transport is proven portable; artifacts record the engine or disabled reason. Token usage is provider-reported when present; dollar cost stays explicit `missing`. Gemini autonomous trigger support is deliberately not advertised: the current `activate_skill` flow requires consent, and a live headless consent-free activation proof has not passed yet.
- **Mistral Vibe**: use `run-agent --agent vibe`, `judge --judge-backend vibe`, and `skill-trigger-matrix --agent vibe`. The harness isolates `VIBE_HOME`, passes `--model` as `VIBE_ACTIVE_MODEL`, mounts trigger skills under `.agents/skills`, and requires `MISTRAL_API_KEY` (or a copied `.env` from the current `VIBE_HOME`, falling back to `~/.vibe/.env`) for live runs.
- **Other runners**: use `prepare` JSONL as the import format and write results back to the run output contract.
- **Jetty**: use `export-jetty`, `run-jetty`, and `import-jetty-results` for REST runbook-mode execution. Live runs require `--out`, keep an exclusively owned atomic attempt journal with secret-safe provider receipts, and resume acknowledged trajectories after interruption or a local polling deadline; unfinished records exit nonzero and cannot be imported. An uncertain submission is blocked unless the operator explicitly accepts duplicate-spend risk with `--resubmit-unknown`. Response shapes were validated against production `flows-api.jetty.io` on 2026-07-17 (captured fixtures in `tests/fixtures/jetty/`); re-verify anytime with the opt-in live smoke — `RUN_JETTY_SMOKE=1 JETTY_API_TOKEN=... JETTY_SMOKE_COLLECTION=<your-collection> python3 -m unittest discover tests -k smoke_jetty` (five real sandbox runs, never in default CI).

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for local setup, validation commands, and eval-safety rules. The short version:

```bash
pip uninstall -y skill-eval-harness   # prints a warning and exits 0 when it is not installed
pip install -e ".[test]"
python3 -m py_compile *.py scripts/*.py examples/adewale-workspace/*.py examples/demo-skill/*.py examples/edited-file-demo/*.py examples/edited-file-demo/evals/fixtures/*.py examples/edited-file-demo/evals/oracles/*.py type_tests/*.py tests/*.py
ruff check .

python3 -m unittest discover tests -v
python3 scripts/check_test_collection_parity.py
python3 scripts/check_installed_wheel.py
```

For manifest or grading changes, add or update `tests/test_skill_benchmark.py`. For docs-only changes, still run the same commands so CLI examples stay tied to current behavior.

## Non-goals

- Grading and aggregation do not call a model. Model execution happens outside that path, in the explicit commands that exist to call one: the runners (`run-codex`, `run-claude`, `run-agent`, `run-subagent`, `run-jetty`, and the `skill-trigger-matrix` / `skill-pi-trigger-eval` entry points), `judge` (via `--judge-cmd` or a native `--judge-backend`), and `judge-robustness`.
- The harness does not decide qualitative truth by itself; it emits judge prompts, runs a judge (an opt-in `--judge-cmd`, or a native `--judge-backend` plus `--judge-model`), and merges the returned JSON — recording which backend/model produced each verdict. The judge prompt is blind to the arm: it carries no `judge_task_id` or `variant`, and arm-named run-path segments (`with_skill/`, `without_skill/`, `old_skill/`, `ablation:<id>/`) in candidate output, trajectory events, or artifact paths are rewritten to `arm/`, so the `with_skill` and `without_skill` prompts for one case with otherwise identical evidence differ only in the candidate output; the task record and result row keep both fields for pairing.
- Hidden prompts are not protected if you pass `--include-answer-key` to generation jobs.
- A passing answer benchmark does not prove autonomous skill loading; run `skill-trigger-matrix` (any adapter-backed agent × model; `skill-pi-trigger-eval` is its Pi-only form) for that.

## Development

```bash
pip uninstall -y skill-eval-harness   # prints a warning and exits 0 when it is not installed
pip install -e ".[test]"
python3 -m py_compile *.py scripts/*.py examples/adewale-workspace/*.py examples/demo-skill/*.py examples/edited-file-demo/*.py examples/edited-file-demo/evals/fixtures/*.py examples/edited-file-demo/evals/oracles/*.py type_tests/*.py tests/*.py
ruff check .
ty check --error-on-warning
python3 -m unittest discover tests -v
python3 scripts/check_test_collection_parity.py
python3 scripts/check_installed_wheel.py
```

The test suite is organized by subject: manifest validation and eval hygiene (`test_manifest.py`), grading (`test_grading.py`), human-text construction and matching (`test_text_contracts.py`), judge plumbing (`test_judging.py`), report views (`test_reporting.py`), closed-form statistics and pair identity (`test_stats.py`, `test_experimental_pairs.py`), runner/Jetty adapters and lifecycle contracts (`test_runners.py`, `test_jetty_contracts.py`), the ablation experiment end to end (`test_ablations.py`), cost telemetry (`test_cost_telemetry.py`), the confidence floor and detector fixtures (`test_confidence_floor.py`), the trigger matrix (`test_trigger_matrix.py`), plus six executable drift guards: doc code references (`test_doc_refs.py`), shared-owner/doc-sync consolidation guards (`test_consolidation_guards.py`), relative-link resolution across the docs (`test_doc_links.py`), doc lists checked against the code they enumerate (`test_doc_facts.py`), Python type/package/semantic coverage (`test_type_coverage.py`), and gate integrity: every CI gate runs unconditionally and can fail, and every skipped test is a ledgered live smoke or a platform gate (`test_gate_integrity.py`). Shared fixture builders live in `tests/helpers.py`.
