# Command reference

Every `skill-benchmark` subcommand, plus the `skill-pi-trigger-eval` and
`skill-trigger-matrix` entry points. The README carries the [core loop](../README.md#core-loop)
and a grouped [command index](../README.md#commands); this file is the per-command detail.

Contracts and safety rules that span commands live elsewhere: the manifest shape and
the run-output contract are in the [README](../README.md#manifest-format), the assertion
catalog is the [README's Assertions section](../README.md#assertions), and the reason
grading never calls a model is [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

Long options must be spelled in full: every entry point, subcommand and script rejects a prefix
(`--judge-res` for `--judge-results`) as an unrecognized argument and exits 2.

On POSIX, a command that runs agents stops the same way on SIGINT (Ctrl-C) or SIGTERM. The native
runners and trigger adapters start each agent in its own session, so the command sends the signal to each
running agent's process group itself. It sends SIGKILL to the group as soon as the agent exits, or
after 2 seconds if the agent is still running. It starts no queued run. A
[fixed recovery case](#run-fixed-recovery-cases) sends SIGKILL at once. The command then prints
`stopped by SIGINT` (or `SIGTERM`) and exits 128 plus the signal number: 130 for SIGINT, 143 for
SIGTERM. Runs that finished before the signal keep their artifacts. `skill-trigger-matrix` and
`skill-pi-trigger-eval` write no report, so a stopped matrix keeps only the `--trace-runs` files of
its finished cells. A signal that was ignored when the command started stays ignored. An
`--agent-cmd` or `--judge-cmd` command runs in the harness's own process group, which Ctrl-C in a
terminal also reaches. `render-viewer --serve` stops its server and exits 0.

## Inspect agent capabilities

```bash
skill-benchmark agent-capabilities
skill-benchmark agent-capabilities --out backend-registry.json
```

`agent-capabilities` renders the unified `agent_capabilities.BACKENDS` rows as
JSON: capability and telemetry contracts, explicit answer route and executable
command entrypoints, native answer/trigger/judge bindings, trace dialect, and
live-smoke policy. Serialization does not dereference lazy handlers or trace
implementations, and the command does not invoke provider implementations or
CLIs; normal CLI import
still materializes the compatibility implementation views.

## Validate

```bash
skill-benchmark validate ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json
skill-benchmark validate ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --strict-holdback
skill-benchmark validate ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --strict-leakage
```

`validate` checks manifest shape, fixture paths, regex syntax, script oracle paths, and hidden-prompt refs. It also warns when a `contains*` assertion value appears literally in the prompt:

```text
WARN pos-ui-no-screenshot: assertion 'detect-ui-no-screenshot' value 'screenshot' appears in prompt (leakage; case may saturate)
```

That warning means a weak answer can pass by echoing the task. Use `--strict-leakage` only after you have replaced noisy keyword checks with scoped regexes, fixture-backed checks, `script` oracles, or judge assertions.

## Prepare tasks

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --runs-per-variant 5 --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --include-ablations --ablation-dir ablated-skills --out ablation-tasks.jsonl
```

`--include-ablations` requires `--ablation-dir DIR` whenever any ablation declares a removal (a `mechanism`/`components` + `target`): the altered skill tree is materialized there and the prepared rows point at it. (A manifest with only instruction-simulated ablations does not need it.)

Use `--include-answer-key` only for judge/debug tasks, never for generation runs.

## Import runner traces

Normalize a raw JSONL trace into `events.json` and `metrics.json` for process and efficiency assertions:

```bash
skill-benchmark import-trace \
  --source codex \
  --trace ../repo/eval-runs/latest/case/with_skill/run-1/trace.jsonl \
  --run-dir ../repo/eval-runs/latest/case/with_skill/run-1 \
  --write-metadata
```

## Run Codex JSONL tasks

The artifact descriptions in this section apply to ordinary answer rows.
`run-codex` also accepts [recovery rows](#run-fixed-recovery-cases) through the shared runner.

`run-codex` is a compatibility wrapper for `run-agent --agent codex`. It executes prepared rows through a command compatible with `codex exec --json`, adds `--output-last-message <file>` for final-answer capture, saves JSONL as `trace.jsonl`, normalizes events/metrics, runs with isolated `CODEX_HOME` outside the model workdir, and records nonzero/timeouts as failed run artifacts. The shared subprocess owner observes CLI-leader exit independently of inherited capture-pipe EOF, then terminates remaining members of the original process group on POSIX before bounded retry/backoff removes the isolated home. An escaped process cannot make pipe draining unbounded: POSIX capture descriptors are closed after a short grace period, while non-POSIX reader threads are abandoned and reported. Cleanup recovery or fallback is recorded in stderr and `environment.json` without replacing an already captured answer. Non-POSIX runs report process-group cleanup as unsupported while retaining bounded, non-throwing home cleanup. Each run also records the model's workspace edits in `workspace-changes.json`, `candidate.patch`, and `candidate-files/` (see the run-output layout in the README); under the default `--sandbox read-only` that change set is empty.

Every invocation also appends `-c skills.bundled.enabled=false`, a `-c skills.config=[...]` entry disabling each `SKILL.md` under `~/.agents/skills` by path, and `--disable apps`, the flags trigger runs use. `environment.json` records them as `context_isolation`, with `skills.config=<N host skill(s) disabled>` in place of the paths, and host skill paths are redacted from the saved command and stderr. The trace (`trace.jsonl`, Codex's stdout) is saved as captured, because it is the run's evidence: a `tool_sequence` assertion reads the paths the model opened from it. So an answer run is not shown host or bundled skills and has no `codex_apps` connector, even inside the isolated `CODEX_HOME`, while skills the run mounts in its workspace's `.agents/skills` stay listed. The flags change what the model is given, not what it can reach: a run that lists `~/.agents/skills` with a shell command still sees the files, because the read-only sandbox allows reads outside the workspace. Auth, `--model`, Codex's built-in tools, and its own `--sandbox`/permission flags keep working as documented by `codex exec --help`. A `--codex-cmd` wrapper still receives the isolation flags, appended after the wrapper's own argv, so a custom Codex launcher cannot silently opt back into host skills or apps:

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark run-codex --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/codex-tune
```

Override `--codex-cmd` for local wrappers or tests. It is an argv-style command prefix parsed with `shlex.split`; shell metacharacters, pipes, and inline env assignments are not interpreted. Put those in a wrapper script and pass the wrapper path instead.

```bash
skill-benchmark run-codex \
  --tasks tasks.jsonl \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/codex-trace \
  --codex-cmd ./bin/codex-jsonl-wrapper
```

## Run native agent tasks

`run-agent` is the provider-neutral native runner. It dispatches prepared rows through a registered backend.
Ordinary rows use the answer-output contract. [Recovery rows](#run-fixed-recovery-cases) use a separate evidence contract.
The compatibility wrappers share both routes:

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark run-agent --agent codex --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/codex-tune \
  --model openai/gpt-5.4-mini
skill-benchmark run-agent --agent claude --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/claude-tune \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
skill-benchmark run-agent --agent gemini --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/gemini-tune \
  --model gemini-2.5-flash
```

Answer, subagent, and trigger runs share one set of Claude flags and one set of Codex flags, described in [Trigger context isolation](agent-parity.md#trigger-context-isolation). They hide host context and keep what a run mounts in its own workspace, so a caller that places skills under `.claude/skills` or `.agents/skills` and agents under `.claude/agents` can still invoke them. Those flags also let both CLIs read skills and instruction files from the folders above the workspace, so an answer or subagent run refuses to start when any folder above its workspace holds `.claude`, `.agents`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `AGENTS.override.md`. The error names the path; set `TMPDIR` to a folder with none of them above it. The default macOS `TMPDIR` is outside your home folder and passes; a `TMPDIR` under a home folder that has `~/.claude` or `~/.agents` does not. A workspace with its own `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` is refused as well, since those carry hooks, env, and permissions, not skills or agents. Judges do not need a project skill and use stricter flags (see [Judge backends](#judge-backends)). These flags were verified against Claude Code CLI 2.1.285 and codex-cli 0.156.1. An unknown `--disable` feature name or an unrecognized Claude flag fails the invocation loudly, so a broken pin on either CLI surfaces immediately as a run failure. An unrecognized Codex `-c` key is accepted silently: a Codex build that renames `skills.config` or `skills.bundled` would expose host skills again while `environment.json` keeps recording `context_isolation` as applied, so that record alone is not proof of isolation on an unverified Codex build.

The Gemini backend invokes the official CLI in headless `stream-json` mode and
accepts final text only from a complete typed stream. It creates a fresh
`GEMINI_CLI_HOME` outside the task workspace, copies only minimal auth state,
rejects workspace `.gemini`, `.agents`, `.geminiignore`, and `GEMINI.md`
controls case-insensitively, requests sandboxing when the selected credentials
can cross Gemini's nested sandbox boundary, and
loads a deny-all policy with a higher-priority allowlist for the five read-only
tools used by answer runs. `--gemini-cmd` accepts exactly one caller-trusted
executable path; free-form launcher/prefix arguments are rejected. Artifacts
record the sandbox/auth transport decision, installed `gemini --version`, and
pinned wire-fixture revision. For ordinary answer rows, token stats are normalized when the CLI returns
them; missing token stats and unsupported dollar cost remain explicit `missing`.

## Run fixed recovery cases

`run-agent` and its `run-codex` and `run-claude` wrappers accept an optional `recovery` object on a prepared row.
Recovery execution requires a POSIX host with process-group signals and `O_DIRECTORY`, `O_NOFOLLOW`, and `O_NONBLOCK`.
Windows recovery execution is unsupported.
Missing required facilities fail the run with exit code 1 and block later phases.
The runner records the failure when it can write `recovery.json`, and evidence may be partial.
The fixed initial, recovery, and refusal phases use fresh processes in one fixture workspace.
Rows without `recovery` stay one-shot. No new command or permission configuration is required.
Recovery rows retain raw evidence and `recovery.json` instead of ordinary answer artifacts, workspace diffs, grades, or normalized paired telemetry.
The [recovery reference](recovery.md) defines the fields, failure states, artifact layout, and evidence limits.
Existing effort forwarding and backend restrictions apply unchanged.

## Run Claude tasks (with cost capture)

The artifact descriptions in this section apply to ordinary answer rows.
`run-claude` also accepts [recovery rows](#run-fixed-recovery-cases) through the shared runner.

`run-claude` is a compatibility wrapper for `run-agent --agent claude`: it executes prepared rows through `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose`, extracts the answer from the stream's terminal `result` event into `output.md` (the stream must carry exactly one `result` and no session content after it, meaning no `assistant`, `user`, `result` or `stream_event` record and no record with a `message` object; any other record after it, such as `system` or `rate_limit_event`, is metadata, and the trace dialect, the Claude judge and the Claude trigger adapter apply the same rule), records real per-run `total_cost_usd` + token usage into `metrics.json`, and keeps the full stream as the run's raw trace — `trace.jsonl` verbatim, normalized tool-use events in `events.json` (a `tool_use` block opens a call, its `tool_result` completes it; an orphaned call counts zero), so process and efficiency assertions have evidence on Claude answer runs. Each run also records the model's workspace edits in `workspace-changes.json`, `candidate.patch`, and `candidate-files/`, captured before the workspace is deleted. The benchmark report then totals `cost_usd_total` per arm (over scorable runs), so a paired eval reports actual dollars:

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark run-claude --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/claude-tune \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

`--model` is optional (omit for the CLI default); `--claude-bin` overrides the executable (a stub in tests). A nonzero exit/timeout is written as a `[CLAUDE FAILURE …]` body, which `execution_valid` treats as a non-scorable infra failure, exactly like the Codex/Jetty runners.

Every invocation also appends `--setting-sources project --strict-mcp-config --settings '{"disableBundledSkills":true,"autoMemoryEnabled":false}'`, recorded as `context_isolation` in `environment.json`, so an answer run is not given `~/.claude` skills, plugins, user agents, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, user hooks and settings, Claude's auto memory for the run's folder, any MCP server, or the skills Claude Code bundles. Skills under the workspace's `.claude/skills` and agents under `.claude/agents` still load, so a `/<skill>` prompt can invoke a skill the run mounts there. `--safe-mode` is not used because it hides those too. The flags change what the model is given, not what it can reach: a run that uses its file tools on `~/.claude` may still read those files. Auth still works (OAuth login is kept; `--bare` would need API-key auth instead), and `--model`, Claude's built-in tools, and its own permission flags keep working as documented by `claude --help`.

## Native answer spend admission

`run-agent`, `run-codex`, and `run-claude` accept `--max-cost-usd` and `--assumed-cost-per-run-usd`. The ceiling applies to one invocation. The command admits a call while its known or assumed spend is below the ceiling, then records that call's charge. A call can overshoot. Refused planned calls receive `not_started` ledger records without answer artifacts or invented return codes, and the command exits 2.

A backend that declares missing dollars requires an assumption before a paid start. A zero ceiling starts no calls. An unexpected missing price closes later admission unless an assumption applies. Charges distinguish observed dollars, labeled assumptions, unknown prices, and proven nonbillable calls. Assumptions cannot be below an observed subtotal.

Claude captures unambiguous reported dollars before validating sibling answer and token fields. A process timeout retains those dollars as an observed subtotal, with unavailable whole-call cost. The ledger closes later admission unless an assumption applies. A $0.01 assumption cannot reduce a $0.06 subtotal. Timeout artifacts retain actual return code 124 and false provider completeness. They never publish that subtotal as full provider cost. Exited responses retain safe full charges even when answer or token validation rejects them. Malformed token records remain raw diagnostics rather than valid normalized usage.

Ledgers live at `runs/spend/<invocation-id>/spend-ceiling.json`. Before dispatch, the harness flushes and syncs the ledger file, then atomically replaces the snapshot. It also syncs the directory where the platform supports it. Unresolved calls remain partial evidence after interruption. A second invocation creates a new ledger and a fresh ceiling. `benchmark` and `cost-summary` include each ledger in `spend_invocations`, separate from artifact-derived grades and model cost totals. The immutable answer design remains unchanged.

A capped batch containing a recovery row rejects before any provider call or runs-root write, including ordinary rows before that recovery row. Uncapped recovery retains its existing behavior. Other execution commands retain their current policies. See [the offline native spend walkthrough](limit-native-spend.md).

## Effort and how answer runs ended

`run-claude`, `run-codex`, and `run-agent` take `--effort {minimal,low,medium,high,xhigh,max}`. Claude applies it as `claude --effort <level>` and Codex as `-c model_reasoning_effort=<level>`. Each backend lists the levels its CLI accepts, and any other level exits before any run directory is written, naming them (`claude --effort accepts low, medium, high, xhigh, max; got minimal`): Claude Code 2.1.288's `--effort` takes `low` through `max` and only warns about `minimal` before running at its default, so `minimal` is refused; Codex 0.160 parses every level the harness offers. Which level a given model honours is still the model's call, and Codex releases before 0.140 reject `max` at startup, which fails the run. Gemini and Vibe have no known effort control, so `run-agent --agent gemini --effort …` (or `vibe`) exits before any run rather than recording a level it never applied.

```bash
skill-benchmark run-agent --agent codex --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/codex-high \
  --effort high
```

The metadata and pairing rules below apply to ordinary answer rows.
Recovery rows retain requested settings and phase observations in `recovery.json` for consumer review.

Each ordinary answer run records `effort: {requested, applied_by}`; the Codex run above records `{"requested": "high", "applied_by": "codex -c model_reasoning_effort"}`, and `run-claude` records `"applied_by": "claude --effort"`. Without `--effort` it records `{"requested": null, "applied_by": "backend_default"}`, because defaults differ by model and CLI version: the claude-api skill lists Claude Opus 5.5's API default effort as `medium` and Claude Opus 5's as `high`.

The same `metadata.json` records how the run stopped and which model answered:

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `stop_class` | One of the values defined under **Stop class** in [`vocabulary.md`](vocabulary.md#run-artifacts). |
| `stop_reason`, `stop_source` | The provider's raw value (or `null`) and where it was read. |
| `requested_model`, `served_model`, `served_models` | The model asked for, the one model credited with the answer (`null` when the run reported several), and every distinct model the run reported, in first-seen order. |
| `served_model_check` | One of the values defined under **Served model check** in [`vocabulary.md`](vocabulary.md#run-artifacts). |

Claude reads the stop reason from the stream-json terminal `result` event (`stop_reason`, with `subtype: error_max_turns` mapped to `turn_limit`) and the served models from each assistant message's `model`, skipping subagent turns (messages that carry `parent_tool_use_id`), because a subagent may run on another model by design. Neither field is in Claude Code's public stream-json reference; Claude Code 2.1.269 writes both, and a stream without them records `unavailable`. Gemini reports its resolved model but no stop reason. Codex, Vibe, and Jetty imports record `unavailable` for both. Vibe's `stop_source` reads `vibe output carries no stop reason`: no field of its programmatic output says why the model stopped, and a turn, price, or token limit makes `vibe` exit 1 instead, which already fails the run. `run-subagent` records what its backend reports: the default Claude backend reads the same stream-json fields, and an `--agent-cmd` reply may carry them ([reply fields](#run-subagent-tasks-in-process-seam-tool-replay-multi-turn)). Every backend then applies the same served-model rule (`completion_contracts.ServedModel`), defined with the check's values in [`vocabulary.md`](vocabulary.md#run-artifacts). Runs written before this change carry none of these fields, and reports count them as `unrecorded`.

A `truncated` or `turn_limit` stop and a served-model `mismatch` make the run unscorable ([execution validity](vocabulary.md#run-artifacts)), because grading a cut-off answer blames the model for the eval's limit and grading another model's answer measures the wrong model. The result row names why in `unscorable_reason` (`stopped:truncated`, `stopped:turn_limit`, `served_model_mismatch`) and the run blocks its pair like any other infrastructure failure. A refusal and a `mixed` served-model run stay graded; the report's [`run_endings`](#how-runs-ended) block counts both, so a refusal's zero reads as a refusal. Result rows copy `stop_class`, `stop_reason`, `served_model`, `served_model_check`, and `effort` from metadata when present.

Pairing checks effort too. Every comparison pairs through a declared contrast (`experimental_pairs.ContrastSpec`) whose `held_fixed` factors must match between the arms; today that is effort. A pair whose arms ran at different effort is blocked as `effort_mismatch`, and one arm with recorded effort against one without is blocked as `effort_unrecorded_on_one_arm`. Runs recorded before effort existed carry none and still pair with each other. The benchmark, the ablation confirmation, and `token-overhead` all pair this way, so each blocks the same pairs.

## Run subagent tasks (in-process seam, tool replay, multi-turn)

`run-subagent` drives prepared rows through an in-process backend — the Claude CLI by default, any provider via `--agent-cmd` (prompt JSON on stdin, `{answer, trace?, usage?, telemetry_scope?, stop_class?, stop_reason?, served_models?}` JSON on stdout), or a plain function in tests. It writes the same run-output contract (plus normalized `events.json`/`metrics.json` from a returned trace), reuses the isolated per-variant workspace (the default Claude backend runs `claude` there, as `run-claude` does, and returns its stream-json records as the trace, which normalize through the Claude trace dialect, so its runs carry the same tool-use evidence for process assertions as `run-claude` runs; a multi-turn run keeps that evidence per turn under `turn-<n>/`) (so the CF.2 baseline-isolation invariant covers it), honors row-level models, and drives multi-turn `turns` sequences into `turn-<n>/output.md`. Each run also records the model's workspace edits in `workspace-changes.json`, `candidate.patch`, and `candidate-files/`, captured before the workspace is deleted. Multi-turn runs capture the final workspace after all turns. Tool I/O can be recorded and replayed deterministically via `--tool-replay record|replay|strict|auto` (or `$SKILL_BENCHMARK_TOOL_REPLAY`), stored as `tool-replay.json` beside each run; `strict` fails closed on an unrecorded call.

```bash
skill-benchmark run-subagent --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs eval-runs/subagent --tool-replay record
```

`--max-cost-usd` sets a per-invocation ceiling for external callback turns. Each required turn has a task digest, run coordinate, and external turn number in the invocation ledger. An admitted call can exceed the ceiling. Every later refused required turn has a `not_started` receipt, with no backend call, history entry, or `turn-N` provider artifact. A single-call task plans turn 1. Provider-internal maximum turns do not create external calls. Any selected recovery row rejects a capped batch before runs-root writes; uncapped behavior is unchanged.

Safe finite, nonnegative JSON `usage.cost_usd` is observed dollars, including zero. The default Claude backend retains its independently parsed dollars and actual exit code even when the provider returns an error or malformed answer. A shell command's strict JSON dollars survive nonzero process exit or bad response schema. The runner stores rejected raw envelopes as diagnostic text under `subagent_rejected_calls`. Invalid, ambiguous, boolean, negative, or nonfinite cost certifies no price. Multi-turn pricing requires explicit `telemetry_scope: turn_delta`. `conversation_cumulative` or omitted scope remains diagnostic evidence, with no subtraction or per-turn charge. An unavailable price closes later admission unless `--assumed-cost-per-run-usd` supplies a labeled charge for each external turn. Assumptions never fill provider telemetry.

After a process timeout, trustworthy captured dollars are a partial subtotal. Strict complete shell JSON and valid original UTF-8 are required. Claude requires one terminal result and no later session content. Neither source proves that a still-running process incurred no further cost. Actual timeout evidence overrides response-body claims. The answer remains rejected, whole-call provider cost remains unavailable, and an assumption cannot reduce the eligible subtotal. Rejection diagnostics retain reported dollars and label their partial availability. Multi-turn subtotals still require explicit `turn_delta` scope.

A refusal or partial unpriced ledger makes the command exit 2. A started conversation with refused required turns publishes an incomplete root with a recognized failure body, false provider completeness, retained actual turn artifacts, safe partial totals, and workspace edits. The root has `artifact_terminal_state: budget_stopped` and null process return code. An opaque rejected or raised callback without actual process evidence uses `response_rejected`, also with no process code; it does not claim `not_started`. Inventory completeness and provider completeness remain independent, so these newly incomplete roots cannot grade as successful conversations. If this invocation starts no call and any destination content already exists, the command preserves all of it and records only the new ledger refusals. Prior output is not a new result. Publication failures preserve settled charges and the previous committed root.

See [the subagent ceiling example](limit-native-spend.md#subagent-external-turns) for an offline run. `benchmark` and `cost-summary` include `spend_invocations` separately from observed provider cost totals. Allowed capped and uncapped calls use the same prompts, answer design, trace dialect, and workspace sidecars.

Three optional reply fields say how the run stopped and which model answered; `run-subagent` records them as the [completion fields](#effort-and-how-answer-runs-ended) `run-claude` writes:

| Reply field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `stop_class` | `completed`, `truncated`, `turn_limit`, `refused`, or `other` (the stop classes in [`vocabulary.md`](vocabulary.md#run-artifacts) except `unavailable`; leave the field out when the stop is unknown). `truncated` and `turn_limit` make the run unscorable. |
| `stop_reason` | The provider's raw stop value, recorded beside the class. |
| `served_models` | The model ids that answered, checked against the requested model. |

Any other `stop_class`, an empty or non-string `stop_reason`, or a `served_models` that is not a list of non-empty strings fails the run with a message naming the field. A `stop_reason` without a `stop_class` is not mapped, because each provider names its stops differently: the run records `unavailable` and its `stop_source` quotes the raw value. A reply without these fields records `unavailable`, as before. The default Claude backend fills them from `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose`, as `run-claude` does, so a `max_tokens` stop records `truncated`. In a multi-turn run, a `truncated` or `turn_limit` turn gives the run its stop class, because every later turn answered a cut-off transcript; otherwise the run ends the way its last turn did. `served_models` collects every turn's models, and each `turn-<n>/metadata.json` records its own turn's evidence.

## Compare judges (judge-sensitivity)

A single judge number is not reproducible across judge choice for a subtle skill. Judge the same runs with two models (`benchmark --judge-results` merges each), then `compare-judges` flags whether the measured lift depends on the judge:

```bash
skill-benchmark compare-judges \
  --report haiku=benchmark.haiku.json \
  --report sonnet=benchmark.sonnet.json \
  --out judge-panel.json
```

It reports each judge's `with_skill − without_skill` combined lift and sets `sign_sensitive` (judges disagree the skill helps), `magnitude_sensitive` (lift spread > `--magnitude-eps`, default 0.1), and `judge_sensitive` (either). Needs ≥2 `--report name=path`. Every verdict from `judge` carries its `judge_model`, so which model graded a run is always recoverable.

`compare-judges` asks *"does the result depend on which judge I picked?"* — not *"is the judge correct?"* For that, validate the judge against **human labels**:

## Validate a judge against human labels (judge-alignment)

Two judges can agree and both be wrong. `judge-alignment` scores a judge's verdicts against a human-labeled gold set, treating the human label as ground truth:

```bash
skill-benchmark judge-alignment \
  --labels feedback.json \
  --judge-results judge-results.jsonl \
  --out judge-alignment.json
```

`--labels` reads the served review's `feedback.json` ([Review viewer](#review-viewer-static-or-served)) directly: an entry that names a judge `assertion` with a `pass` or `fail` verdict becomes the label for that assertion's `judge_task_id`. Run-level entries and `unsure` or note-only entries are skipped and counted in the report's `label_source`, `{"format": "feedback", "skipped": {"run_level": n, "unsure_or_note_only": n, "unparsed": n}}`, where `unparsed` counts the old entries kept under `unparsed_entries` (always present, `0` when there are none). The legacy file keyed by `judge_task_id` with a `passed` bool still loads, as `label_source: {"format": "judge_task_labels"}`.

It reports `agreement`, **Cohen's `cohen_kappa`** (chance-corrected, so an imbalanced label set can't flatter the judge) with a `kappa_interpretation` band, and `precision`/`recall`/`f1` plus the `confusion` matrix. Below `--min-labels` (default 50) matched labels it warns that the metrics are unstable. Fully model-free — it grades a judge you already ran.

A `calibration` block adds the `brier` score, 10-bin expected calibration error (`ece`) with its `reliability` bins, `auroc`, and a `threshold_sweep` over the observed scores with the `best_f1` threshold. It covers only judges the harness passes on `score >= threshold`: plain scored judges (`threshold` or `atLeast`), `per_step` judges (`min_met_fraction`), and consensus over plain scored members sharing one threshold (`--judge-panel` without `--quorum`, or `--judge-runs` repeats), including even-member ties resolved by the median score. There the score and the pass call share one scale, so `best_f1.threshold` compares directly with the thresholds listed in `decision_rules`. Dynamic-rubric, graded-dimension, quorum-consensus, mixed-member consensus, and boolean judges pass by another rule, so their verdicts are excluded with a reason, and a report with no calibrated verdict gets `availability: "not_applicable"`. Any metric that is undefined for the labels given is `null` with a warning. See [Can I trust my judge?](can-i-trust-my-judge.md) for how to read it.

The end-to-end calibration loop over this command, `compare-judges`, and `judge-robustness` — runnable offline on the demo — is [`can-i-trust-my-judge.md`](can-i-trust-my-judge.md).

## Error analysis (open coding → axial taxonomy)

`error-analysis` turns a `benchmark.json` into the "look at your data" surface: an open-coding **review queue** (one row per failing/errored run, anchored on its *first* upstream failure, with an open `note` slot) and an axial **failure taxonomy** (first-failures counted by category, so the few dominant buckets are visible), alongside the report's own case-flag histogram. Model-free.

```bash
skill-benchmark error-analysis --benchmark benchmark.json --out error-analysis.json
skill-benchmark error-analysis --benchmark benchmark.json --feedback feedback.json --out error-analysis.json
```

Queue rows carry `run_number`. `--feedback` reads the served review's `feedback.json`: a run-level judgement (one naming no assertion) for the same case, model, variant, and run fills that row's `note` and adds `human_verdict`, so a note written while reading the run is not typed again here. A missing file adds nothing; a malformed one is an error.

## Pi trace runners

The Adewale Pi smoke example writes the trace-aware run layout directly:

```bash
python3 examples/adewale-workspace/run_pi_smoke.py \
  --run-name trace-smoke \
  --selection /tmp/selection.json
```

The runner uses an isolated temporary workspace. `with_skill` receives copied skill files and fixtures. `without_skill` receives fixtures only and runs with `--no-skills`, so grep/find/read cannot discover the source repo's `skills/*/SKILL.md` or public eval manifests.

`skill-pi-trigger-eval` can also write per-query trace artifacts:

```bash
skill-pi-trigger-eval ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --eval-set trigger-queries.json \
  --out trigger-results.json \
  --trace-runs trigger-traces
```

## Grading options

`grade`, `benchmark`, `aggregate`, `export-anthropic`, and `audit-manifest` take the same four options, because each grades runs (or rebuilds the benchmark it reports) and must grade them the same way:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--judge-results FILE` | Merge judge verdicts keyed by `judge_task_id` (JSONL or JSON). Without them, a manifest with judge assertions grades as partial and the lift headlines are withheld. |
| `--allow-scripts` | Run the manifest's `script` oracles. Off by default, because it executes repo-supplied commands. |
| `--strict` | Promote soft-severity assertions to gates. A grading option, not a gate: it changes how verdicts score, not whether a command fails. |
| `--embed-cmd CMD` | Enable `similarity` with `mode: "embedding"` through an external command (stdin `{texts: [a, b]}`, stdout `{embeddings: [[..], [..]]}`). |

`token-overhead` takes `--judge-results` only. Every `skill-benchmark` report command's `--out` creates missing parent directories, for JSON, markdown, HTML, and JSONL output alike.

## Grade

`grade` produces per-run grading rows and can emit pending judge tasks:

```bash
skill-benchmark grade ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --out grade-report.json \
  --judge-tasks judge-tasks.jsonl
```

Write Anthropic-compatible `grading.json` files into each run directory:

```bash
skill-benchmark grade ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --write-grading-files
```

## Benchmark

`benchmark` aggregates graded rows into variant summaries, paired deltas (with sign-flip `significance`, a confidence `interval`, a `noise_check`, and a `graded` channel), per-model grouping (`by_model`, `model_analysis` ranking and lift losers), slice summaries with lift concentration, oracle-strength shares, held-out vs tune-visible qualitative rates, a `run_endings` block, and case flags. The report's `availability` is `partial` exactly when `incomplete_reasons` is non-empty; each entry names a root cause: `answer_design_incomplete` (a planned case arm has no run), `unscorable_answer_attempts`, `deferred_judge_verdicts` (pass `--judge-results`), `grading_evidence_incomplete` (an assertion could not be graded for a reason other than a pending verdict), or `incomplete_answer_pairing` (a pair blocked for a reason other than an unscorable run, such as `effort_mismatch`; listed beside `unscorable_answer_attempts` when both occur). An unscorable run also blocks its pair, and a pending verdict also leaves its row's grading partial; neither consequence is listed twice. A case with no objective assertion in either arm (one gated only by judges) is outside the objective pairing rather than blocked: `pairing.not_applicable_pairs` counts its pairs, and its verdicts still count in the combined rate. It takes the shared [grading options](#grading-options); add `--allow-scripts` only when you trust the repo-owned oracle commands in the manifest. `--min-lift X` (0 < X ≤ 1) names the smallest pass-rate lift you would act on, which the noise check compares against.

```bash
skill-benchmark benchmark ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --allow-scripts \
  --judge-results judge-results.jsonl \
  --min-lift 0.1 \
  --out benchmark.json
```

Multi-model runs prepare with `--models a,b,c` (run dirs gain a model segment: `<case>/<model>/<variant>`); grading discovers both layouts and pairs lift per (case, model).

### Lift interval and noise check

`significance` answers whether the observed lift beats chance. Two fields beside it, on `paired_summary` and on each `by_model` entry, answer how large the lift could be and whether the eval could have shown it at all.

`significance`, `interval`, and `noise_check` each carry `unit`, the inference unit their test counts: `case` here, one delta per (case, model) averaged over its repetitions ([inference unit](vocabulary.md#report-signals)). `effect_estimates.Estimate` builds all three from one set of deltas.

`interval` is `{method, confidence: 0.95, n, lower, upper, bounded, unit}`. It inverts the sign-flip test: the interval holds every shift the test would not reject, so when it is bounded it excludes zero exactly when the `significance` block rejects "no lift", on either path. `method` is `sign-flip-inversion-exact` while the sign patterns of the units that moved reach at most 2^14 distinct (sum, weight) outcomes, and `sign-flip-inversion-sampled` beyond that. The sampled path draws 4,096 seeded sign patterns and decides on an upper confidence bound on p (a relative-entropy, or Chernoff, bound; it fails with probability at most 0.001 over all draws), which reaches about 0.002 when no pattern is as extreme as the observed one. While the bounds straddle alpha it draws four times as many, up to 2^18, where a decision still open is "not significant"; `significance.sampled_patterns` says how many it drew, and the interval reads the same patterns, so the two still decide alike. Unchanged units never count, since flipping a zero changes no sum; equal deltas count once with their multiplicity; and pass-rate deltas, which are whole numbers of runs (or assertions) over the repeats, are summed as whole numbers, so the many patterns that reach one sum count once. Any eval with at most 14 moved units is therefore exact (up to about 4,000 unchanged ones), as is a larger one whose deltas repeat or are pass rates: each of 300 simulated binary evals of 15–40 cases at 3 to 12 repeats per arm is exact. Graded-score deltas, which take arbitrary values, are the usual sampled case. `significance` takes the same path. With five or fewer units no shift can be rejected at 95%, so the block reads `bounded: false` with null endpoints and a `reason`. It reads the same when every unit's delta is equal (every case gained one full run, say): the test reads only signs, so it rejects every shift but that value, and the point that leaves is no bound. `significance` can still reject "no lift" there. `paired_summary.graded` carries its own `interval` over graded-score deltas.

`noise_check` reports `cases`, `cases_moved` (units whose delta is non-zero), `cases_needed_for_alpha` (6 at `alpha` 0.05), `smallest_achievable_p` (`2 / 2**k` for `k` moved units), `noise_floor` (the interval's half-width), `headroom` (1 minus the `without_skill` pass rate), and `min_lift` when `--min-lift` is set. Its `verdict` is the first limit found, checked in this order:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `no-data` | No paired units. |
| `too-few-cases-moved` | Fewer units moved than `cases_needed_for_alpha`, so no p-value can reach `alpha`. Five units that all improved still stop at p = 0.0625. |
| `unbounded` | The interval has no finite bounds; its `reason` is copied here (for example, every delta is equal). |
| `noise-exceeds-headroom` | `noise_floor` ≥ `headroom`: no skill could clear the noise. |
| `noise-exceeds-min-lift` | `noise_floor` ≥ `min_lift`: the eval cannot resolve the smallest lift you would act on. |
| `resolvable` | None of the above. |

When the noise floor reaches the target (`min_lift`, else `headroom`), `projected_cases` scales the current unit count by `(noise_floor / target)**2`. It is an estimate of the cases needed, not a guarantee.

When pairing is incomplete, both fields move to `observed_interval` / `observed_noise_check` and the headline fields read `{"availability": "unavailable", "reason": "incomplete_pairing"}`, like the other headline fields. When every pair forms but the report is partial because a planned arm has no run or an assertion could not be graded, the same move happens on `paired_summary`, each `by_model` entry and `paired_edit_summary`, with `reason` (and `design_coverage_reason`) reading `answer_design_incomplete` or `grading_evidence_incomplete`; `graded` then moves to `observed_graded` and reads `{"availability": "partial", "delta": null, "reason": ...}`. A `graded` block also reads `partial` with a `null` delta when some pair is blocked, for example by a soft judge whose `score` is outside 0–1 (`blocked_reason_counts` names `invalid_graded_score`): the channel takes normalized scores, so return 0–1, use `graded_dimensions` or `atLeast`, or declare the judge's own scale as `score_scale: [low, high]`, which the harness normalizes ([graded score](vocabulary.md#things-you-assert)).

### The edit against the previous revision

When `--variant` selects an `old_skill` arm beside `with_skill` (`benchmark --variant with_skill --variant without_skill --variant old_skill`), the report adds `paired_edit_summary`: the current skill against the revision it replaces, paired per (case, model) within this run under the `skill_edit` contrast. It carries `current_objective_pass_rate`, `previous_objective_pass_rate`, `delta`, the same `significance`, `interval`, and `noise_check` blocks as `paired_summary` (with `headroom` measured on the previous revision), `regressed_cases` (each `{case_id, current, previous, delta, model?}`), `availability`, and `pairing`. A missing arm blocks its pair as `missing_old_skill` or `missing_with_skill`, and a partial comparison withholds its headline under `observed_*`, as `paired_summary` does. Without an `old_skill` arm the key is absent.

### How runs ended

`run_endings.by_variant` counts every run's `stop_class`, `served_model_check`, and effort level per variant; runs that predate these fields count as `unrecorded`. A `stop_class` or `served_model_check` recorded with an earlier spelling is counted under that spelling; effort is counted by the requested level, so an unpinned run is `backend_default` whatever its `applied_by` reads. The totals are `refused_runs`, `cut_off_runs` (truncated plus turn-limited), `served_model_mismatches`, `served_model_mixed`, and `effort_levels`. `notes` explains each non-zero total (a `mixed` run is scored, but no single model can be credited with it) and warns when a multi-model report ran every arm at `backend_default` effort. Counts include unscorable runs, because the block describes what the eval ran rather than what it scored; the fields are defined under [Effort and how answer runs ended](#effort-and-how-answer-runs-ended).

### Floor and ceiling case flags

A case whose two arms score the same extreme stops discriminating in one of two ways. `saturated/non-discriminating` is the ceiling: both arms have an objective pass rate of 1.0 on every scored pair, so the base model already does the task. `floor: fails in both arms` is the floor: both arms score 0 on every scored pair on the combined score (objective and gate-judge checks together, with a soft judge's graded score blended in when the case has no gate judge), the same rule that puts a case in readiness's `floor_cases`. A case whose objective checks fail in both arms but whose judge passes one arm is not a floor. A floor case also carries `no objective lift`, but the likelier cause is a broken case or assertion rather than a hard task, so `suggest-cases` never seeds it and `audit-manifest` reports it as `floor-eval`. A case gated only by judges has no objective pass rate, so every flag on it, the ceiling included, reads that combined score, and its entry's `signal` reads `combined` (`objective` otherwise; see [case flag signal](vocabulary.md#report-signals)).

## CI report formats

`report` serializes a `benchmark.json` for CI: `--format junit` writes one `<testcase>` per case/variant/run with evidence on failures and the paired lift as suite properties; `--format github` writes job-summary markdown plus `::warning` annotations per flagged case (and an `::error` on negative lift); a partial report opens with its experiment status, naming each of the report's `incomplete_reasons` once.

```bash
skill-benchmark report --benchmark benchmark.json --format junit --out junit.xml
skill-benchmark report --benchmark benchmark.json --format github --out "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
```

Rendering alone returns zero for complete or partial reports. Add `--fail-on-failures`
to check the saved evidence and the `with_skill` variant. Repeat `--gate-variant` to
select other variants instead. This option requires `--fail-on-failures` and rejects
duplicates or unsupported variant names.

```bash
skill-benchmark report --benchmark benchmark.json --format junit --out junit.xml \
  --fail-on-failures
skill-benchmark report --benchmark benchmark.json --format github \
  --fail-on-failures --gate-variant with_skill --gate-variant ablation:preserve-behavior
```

The gate writes the same report before returning its verdict. Exit 0 means that all
selected runs have applicable gate assertions and pass their non-soft checks.
Exit 1 means incomplete experiment evidence, an empty selected cohort, a failed
selected check, a critical veto, or a reference-floor failure. Completeness applies
to every arm, including unselected baseline and ablation runs. Expected baseline
assertion failures do not reject the default gate. Exit 2 means invalid arguments,
unreadable or malformed JSON, or a report shape that cannot be rendered. Gate
reasons go to stderr. The saved report gate does not reopen run artifacts or apply a
lift, rate, or significance threshold.

The full CI gating recipe — both report formats plus the manifest-trust gate — is [`gating-ci-on-evals.md`](gating-ci-on-evals.md).

## Trend, staleness, and harder-case suggestions

`trend` keeps an append-only history of benchmark reports and emits the series, successive diffs, recurring failures ranked by prevalence x severity, and prune candidates (cases that never failed and never discriminated across the history — suggestions only, nothing is deleted). `suggest-cases` turns saturated/no-lift flags into harder-case candidate seeds; generation is opt-in behind `--generate-cmd` and never edits a manifest. It skips floor cases, because a case nothing passes points at the case or its assertions, and making it harder cannot restore signal. Each seed's instruction asks for one harder variant "exercising what the skill teaches, and hard for a reason a domain expert would name rather than because today's model happens to fail it", requires the rationale to say why the case is hard, and says a new case belongs in the tune split until it has been measured.

```bash
skill-benchmark trend --history eval-history --add benchmark.json --out trend.json
skill-benchmark suggest-cases --benchmark benchmark.json --manifest evals/shared-benchmark.json --out candidates.json
```

## Migrate a manifest

`migrate` upgrades a version-1 manifest to version 2: stamps default severities and oracle tiers, marks binary judge rubrics with a `graded?` todo, prints the diff plus the judgment-call checklist (`--check` for a dry run, `--out-checklist` to save it). See [`migrating-evals.md`](migrating-evals.md) for the agent runbook.

## Judge backends

Run deferred `judge`/`rubric` assertions with either a native backend (`--judge-backend claude`, `--judge-backend codex`, `--judge-backend gemini`, or `--judge-backend vibe`) or a shell command (`--judge-cmd`) that reads one grading prompt from stdin and emits JSON on stdout. The prompt contains the original case prompt, `expected_behavior`, `review_rubric`, the assertion, and the saved candidate output.

```bash
skill-benchmark judge ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-backend claude \
  --judge-model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 \
  --transcripts judge-transcripts \
  --out judge-results.jsonl

skill-benchmark judge ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \

  --out judge-results.gemini.jsonl

skill-benchmark judge ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \

  --judge-cmd 'claude -p' \
  --transcripts judge-transcripts \
  --out judge-results.jsonl

skill-benchmark benchmark ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-results judge-results.jsonl \
  --out benchmark.json
```

Native Claude uses `claude -p --output-format json --no-session-persistence --safe-mode --disable-slash-commands`, so judges are not given skills, agents, instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`), hooks, or MCP servers, whether they come from the operator's home or from the folder the judge runs in; tool-using judges keep `--safe-mode` too; tool-free judges add `--tools ""`, and every native Claude judge passes the harness verdict schema through `--json-schema`. Native Codex uses isolated `CODEX_HOME` outside the model workdir, `-c skills.include_instructions=false --disable apps` so no skill is listed at all, plus `codex exec --output-last-message <file> --output-schema <schema.json>` so verdict parsing reads the final assistant message rather than the event JSONL stream. Native Gemini uses isolated `GEMINI_CLI_HOME`, `--output-format stream-json`, conditional nested sandboxing, and a deny-all tool policy; only the stream's final validated assistant segment reaches verdict parsing, while the raw lifecycle stream and session/model metadata are saved as transcript sidecars. It rejects observed tool lifecycles and nonzero aggregate tool counts. Native Vibe uses isolated `VIBE_HOME` outside the model workdir plus `vibe --prompt "$PROMPT" --output json` with tools disabled (`--enabled-tools re:^$`) and reads the final assistant message as the verdict JSON; `--judge-model` is passed through `VIBE_ACTIVE_MODEL`. Native judges run from an explicit working directory: a sanitized run-copy when tool exploration is enabled (it leaves out oracle files, symlinks, and every `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, `.claude/`, and `.agents/` at any depth, since a run's `outputs/` holds whatever the candidate wrote), otherwise a fresh empty temp directory so they cannot accidentally read the harness repo cwd. For Codex/OpenAI structured output, the harness adapts the canonical verdict schema into a strict provider schema (`additionalProperties:false`; optional fields become nullable) while still validating the returned verdict against the canonical schema. Gemini and Vibe do not expose provider-enforced schema here, so harness-side schema validation is the gate. A shell judge command should return JSON like `{"passed": true, "score": 4, "rationale": "..."}`. Bare or fenced JSON is accepted using `json.raw_decode` scanning rather than brace counting. `--transcripts` saves the exact prompt, stdout, stderr, parsed result, and any provider response/metadata sidecars.

### Repeated judges and panels

`--judge-runs N` judges each task N times with one judge; `--judge-panel MODEL` (repeat it for two or more models) judges each task once per model. Both fold the member verdicts with one rule, `judge_verdict.resolve_consensus`: a strict majority passes, `--quorum K` (panels only; `judge` refuses it without a panel of two or more judges) passes on K passing members instead, and an exact tie without quorum is decided by the median score when a score and an explicit numeric threshold are available. The tie passes when the median is `>= threshold` and resolves as failure below that threshold. A tie lacking either fails with `unresolved: true`. Each merged row carries an `agreement` block, `{concur, n, concur_fraction, unanimous, unresolved, quorum}`, so a judge that disagrees with itself on identical input shows up per task. `quorum` records the configured minimum number of passing members, or `null` for majority consensus; `concur` records the observed passing-member count. Calibration excludes older panel rows without a recorded quorum because their decision rule cannot be established. Repeated-judge rows can establish majority consensus from their recorded members without that field. A verdict field set to `null` reads as absent unless the verdict schema requires it. Grading keeps a merged row's own pass, also under `atLeast` and `score_scale`, rather than re-deciding it from the median score; the member verdicts stay under `judge_runs` (repeats) or `judge_panel` (panel).

## Audit manifest quality

```bash
skill-benchmark audit-manifest ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --format markdown \
  --out eval-audit.md
```

Add `--runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest` to include saturated-case, floor, no-lift, flaky repeated-run, and per-assertion discrimination analysis, plus the run-measured findings behind eval-health marks 3–5. The audit grades those runs the way `benchmark` does and takes the same [grading options](#grading-options). Without `--judge-results`, a manifest with judge assertions yields a partial benchmark, so readiness reports the `benchmark-incomplete` blocker and eval-health marks 3 and 4 read `unavailable` (mark 5 too, unless a run-condition finding names a cause). `--min-lift X` (with `--runs`) sets the smallest lift worth acting on for the noise check behind mark 4; like `benchmark --min-lift`, it must lie in (0, 1], and any other value stops the command before any work with a usage error (exit 2).

The JSON report carries `counts`, `taxonomy`, `findings`, `recommendations`, `recommended_fixture_repos_files`, `readiness`, `known_answer_check`, `case_sources`, `eval_health`, `benchmark`, and `benchmark_availability`. `--format markdown` renders the counts, readiness, an **Eval health** table, the findings, and the recommendations. The audit reports:

- a **readiness** verdict, "is this eval worth paying to run?": ablations materialized vs instruction-simulated, `leak_saturated_cases`, `adversarial_cases`, `objective_only_cases` and `judge_only_cases`, and with `--runs`, `base_saturated_cases`, `floor_cases`, `qualitative_only_cases` and `regression_guards_holding`. The blockers are typed findings in `blocker_findings`, with their messages repeated in `blockers`; `benchmark-incomplete` carries the benchmark's `incomplete_reasons` as evidence and says what to do about each, and the eval-health notes for marks 3–5 repeat that remedy; the terms and the six blocking kinds are defined under **Readiness** in [`vocabulary.md`](vocabulary.md#report-signals);
- missing positive, negative, and adversarial eval coverage,
- missing holdout/holdback split coverage,
- missing trigger/no-trigger coverage,
- missing domain/difficulty/success-goal taxonomy for slice summaries,
- where the cases came from: `case_sources` counts each case's declared `source` (`production`, `bug-report`, `hand-written`, `synthesized`, or `imported`); a suite where any case records none gets `case-source-unrecorded`, and one where every case is `synthesized` gets `synthesized-cases-only`,
- the **known-answer check** (`known_answer_check`, model-free): every non-trigger case with at least one gate or critical text check (`contains`, `contains_any`, `contains_all`, `excludes_any`, `regex`, `not_regex`) takes part. A declared reference answer must pass every such check, or the case is listed in `reference_failures` with a `reference-answer-fails` finding. The null answer, the case's prompt echoed back, must fail at least one, or the case is listed in `null_answer_passes` with a `null-answer-passes` finding. Only a case whose gate checks are all text checks and whose prompt is inline (`prompt` or `turns`, not a private `prompt_ref`) is null-checked, and a case readiness already reports as leak-saturated is not reported again. The block also counts `references_checked` and `null_answers_checked`,
- ablation-plan suggestions from major skill sections,
- the instruction-simulated ablations that should be materialized (and dangling/unknown ablation references),
- saturated and no-lift cases when run data is available, with a `floor-eval` (recommended) finding in place of `no-lift-eval` for a floor case, regression-intent cases included,
- assertions with identical with/without pass rates,
- recommended fixture repos/files, and
- **eval health**, the five marks rated from these findings (below).

### Eval health

`eval_health` is a view over the audit's findings and readiness blockers, not a second copy of them (`findings.eval_health`). Each finding kind counts against at most one mark; the mapping is the five-marks table in [`comparing-with-claude-api-evals.md`](comparing-with-claude-api-evals.md#five-marks-of-a-lift-eval). A mark with a finding of its kinds is `concern`; a mark whose evidence was observed with no such finding is `ok`; any other mark is `unavailable`, which is not the same as `ok`. Mark 1 is observed when at least one case records a `source`, mark 2 when the known-answer check graded a reference or a null answer, and marks 3–5 when `--runs` points at a complete benchmark. Mark 5's run-condition kinds (`arm-conditions-differ`, `served-model-mismatch`, `served-model-mixed`) are read from the runs present and raised on an incomplete benchmark too, since they are often its cause, so mark 5 can read `concern` beside the `benchmark-incomplete` blocker. The block is `{"marks": [...], "counts": {"ok": n, "concern": n, "unavailable": n}}`, and each mark is `{mark, id, question, status, finding_kinds, notes?}`. Real output on `examples/demo-skill` with six runs per arm and the stub judge's verdicts (2026-09-30), marks 1 and 4, reformatted:

```json
{"mark": 1, "id": "realistic-cases",
 "question": "Are the cases realistic, and does the skill load the way real use loads it?",
 "status": "concern",
 "finding_kinds": ["missing-positive-evals", "missing-negative-evals", "missing-adversarial-evals",
                   "missing-trigger-no-trigger-cases", "case-source-unrecorded"],
 "notes": ["activation is forced: the task tells the agent to use the skill, while real use relies on discovery (issue #48)"]},
{"mark": 4, "id": "noise-below-min-lift",
 "question": "Is the noise smaller than the smallest lift worth acting on?",
 "status": "concern", "finding_kinds": ["underpowered-eval"]}
```

What each mark asks, and why the harness uses these five rather than the hillclimbing post's four, is [`comparing-with-claude-api-evals.md`](comparing-with-claude-api-evals.md#five-marks-of-a-lift-eval).

### Gate it in CI

`--fail-on-blockers` makes `audit-manifest` exit non-zero when the readiness block has any blockers, so a skill repo can keep its eval suite at "worth paying to run" the same way it keeps tests green:

```bash
skill-benchmark audit-manifest evals/shared-benchmark.json --fail-on-blockers
```

`--strict-judge` exits non-zero on a `judge-is-model-under-test` finding. For anything else, `--fail-on KINDS` takes finding kinds, severities (`required`, `recommended`), or presets, comma-separated and repeatable, and exits 1 when a finding or readiness blocker matches; each reason is printed to stderr as `fail-on: <kind>: <message>`. An unknown token stops the command before any work (`unknown --fail-on token 'florr-eval': use a finding kind, a severity, or one of: blockers, contamination, judge-robustness, recommended, required, strict-judge`). When `--runs` points at an incomplete benchmark, `--fail-on` fails closed rather than passing on findings it never computed.

The presets are the same policies the older flags apply (`gate_policy.PRESETS`): `blockers` is the six readiness kinds that `--fail-on-blockers` gates on, and `strict-judge` is `judge-is-model-under-test`. `contamination` (`canary-hit`, `output-answer-overlap`, `released-before-cutoff`) and `judge-robustness` (`order-flip-inconsistent`, `passes-empty-control`, `passes-master-key-control`, `judge-call-incomplete`) are the policies `contamination --fail-on-contamination` and `judge-robustness --fail-on-findings` apply in their own commands, and like `--fail-on` they fail closed on incomplete evidence; `audit-manifest` does not run those checks, so in its `--fail-on` those two presets match nothing. `--strict` is a grading option, not a gate: it changes how verdicts score, not whether the command fails.

The systematic way to upgrade a suite is to drive those blockers to empty, repo by repo: materialize the ablations (`materialize-ablations` / declare a `mechanism`+`target`), de-leak the leak-saturated cases (move the answer out of the prompt, or assert a downstream consequence), and add adversarial cases where missing — then the gate goes green. The walkthrough is [`gating-ci-on-evals.md`](gating-ci-on-evals.md).

### Finding kinds

Every finding the harness emits has a registered kind in `findings.FindingKind`, which fixes what it is about, its default severity, and the eval-health mark it counts against ([mapping](comparing-with-claude-api-evals.md#five-marks-of-a-lift-eval)). This table lists every kind; `--fail-on` accepts any of them.

| Kind | About | Default severity | Raised by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `missing-domain-taxonomy` | eval | recommended | `audit-manifest` |
| `missing-difficulty-taxonomy` | eval | recommended | `audit-manifest` |

| `canary-hit` | eval | required | `contamination` |
| `output-answer-overlap` | eval | recommended | `contamination` |
| `released-before-cutoff` | eval | recommended | `contamination` |

Of the mark 3–5 kinds from `audit-manifest --runs` that do not come from case flags, `suite-headroom-exhausted` and `underpowered-eval` are raised only when that benchmark is complete; `arm-conditions-differ`, `served-model-mismatch` and `served-model-mixed` name a cause in the runs present and are raised on a partial benchmark too, beside `benchmark-incomplete`. Per-case benchmark flags are the closed set `findings.CaseFlag`, whose values are the exact strings reports carry; `flaky repeated pass rates`, `critical-failure` and `below-reference-floor` add `: <detail>`.

## Contamination perimeter (output-side, model-free)

```bash
skill-benchmark contamination ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --model-cutoff 2025-01 \
  --fail-on-contamination \
  --out contamination.json
```

Three model-free checks over saved outputs: a canary tripwire (a case's declared canary string appearing through the `rendered-v1` human-text view), output↔answer-key n-gram containment through that same view (`--ngram`, flagged above `--overlap-threshold`), and a `released_at`-vs-`--model-cutoff` gate for cases the model may have seen in training. `coverage` counts the answer runs whose output was read, one per (case, model, arm, run) that run discovery finds (`expected_runs`, `scanned_runs`, `availability`, and `unscanned`, each entry `{case_id, model, variant, run_number}`); another model's output never stands in for a missing one, and trigger cases have no answer output and are not counted. `--fail-on-contamination` makes it a CI gate: it exits 1 on a finding, and on any run in `unscanned`, since an output never read cannot be shown clean. Each reason goes to stderr as `contamination: <reason>`.

## Judge robustness probes

```bash
skill-benchmark judge-robustness ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-model claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --fail-on-findings \
  --out judge-robustness.json
```

Probes a judge's stability before you trust its verdicts (model-touching; opt-in): order-flip self-consistency plus empty-output and master-key negative controls a robust judge must reject. Takes the same `--judge-cmd`/`--judge-model` backends as `judge`; `--fail-on-findings` makes it a CI gate that exits 1 on a finding and when `summary.availability` is not `complete`, printing each reason as `judge-robustness: <reason>`.

## Cost telemetry (tokens and dollars)

For ordinary answer rows, trigger runs, and judge runs, runner paths write legacy-compatible normalized blocks beside raw provider fields and an availability-aware telemetry v3 envelope.
These paths include Pi smoke, Pi trigger, `run-agent`, `run-codex`, `run-claude`, `run-subagent`, the judge wrapper, and the Jetty importer.
The envelope appears in both `metadata.json` and `metrics.json`.
Recovery rows retain raw evidence and `recovery.json` for the consumer. They do not emit these normalized blocks or normalized paired telemetry.

This section owns the three source lists; they come from `observation_contracts.py`, and the answer path and the trigger path validate against the same sets.

- `usage_normalized`: alias-normalized token counts (`input`/`prompt_tokens`/`totalTokens`/cache/reasoning variants) with a `source` from `USAGE_SOURCES`: `provider_reported` (relayed from the provider), `trace_normalized` (summed from normalized trace events), `estimated`, `missing`, or `not_applicable`. Token counts are never priced, so `price_table_estimated` is not a usage source.
- `cost_normalized`: legacy-compatible dollar block with `currency`, per-part costs, and a `source` from `COST_SOURCES`: `provider_reported`, `trace_normalized`, `price_table_estimated`, `missing`, or `not_applicable`. A cost estimate always names its price table, so a bare `estimated` cost is rejected. When a provider reports cost parts but no total, the block reads `{"source": "missing", "currency": …, "observed_parts": {…}, "reason": "partial_cost_components"}`: the parts stay diagnostics and never become a total.
- The v3 `telemetry` envelope separates availability (`available`, `unavailable`, or `not_applicable`) from the provenance an available number carries, one of `MEASUREMENT_PROVENANCE`: `provider_reported`, `trace_normalized`, `process_measured` (timed by the harness around the provider process, as elapsed time is), `price_table_estimated`, `estimated`, or `legacy_unverified`. `missing` is not a provenance: it is the unavailable state. A measured `$0` is available; unknown cost is never zero.

Consumers of the blocks:

- `benchmark`/`aggregate` emit `cost_summary` with availability-aware coverage and operational totals over ordinary answer attempts, including execution errors. Quality rates exclude those errors. A mixed set renders a partial known subtotal, not a false total. Per-variant stats, per-case spend, paired deltas, ablation marginal cost, and judge spend retain their basis/provenance.
- `cost-summary` writes the standalone suite ledger (`--out cost-summary.json`, `--md cost-summary.md`): coverage, totals, by variant/case/runner, top expensive cases and ablation arms, and `cost_quality_findings` when a `--benchmark` report is joined.
- `suite-run` projects spend **before any model call** from previous ledgers (`--cost-history <dir>`, per-run medians) or a static assumption (`--assumed-tokens-per-run`), and gates on `--max-estimated-tokens` / `--max-estimated-cost-usd` — failing closed when a dollar cap is set but no dollar estimate exists — unless `--allow-over-budget`.
- `audit-manifest --runs` adds cost-quality findings above `--expensive-case-usd` (default $1): `expensive-saturated-case`, `expensive-no-lift-case`, `high-cost-judge-only-case`, `ablation-high-spend-no-structured-regression`, and `high-footprint-low-lift-skill`.

Interpretation rule: `provider_reported` numbers are a direct provider envelope; `trace_normalized` reconstructs usage or cost from event streams; `unavailable` means the run carried no usable telemetry — fix the runner path rather than treating it as free. Lift-per-dollar is emitted only for scorable, basis-compatible paired costs with a strictly positive incremental cost; otherwise JSON/Markdown report a blocked reason. The complete contract and migration policy are in [`telemetry-availability-and-comparability-spec.md`](telemetry-availability-and-comparability-spec.md).

```bash
skill-benchmark cost-summary \
  --manifest ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --benchmark benchmark.json \
  --out cost-summary.json \
  --md cost-summary.md
```

Upgrade existing run directories without guessing provenance:

```bash
skill-benchmark migrate-telemetry --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest --check
skill-benchmark migrate-telemetry --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest
```

The first command is byte-preserving; the second atomically adds schema v3 envelopes and any missing sibling artifact. Legacy numeric values are labelled `legacy_unverified` and do not qualify for causal lift-per-dollar comparisons.

## Profile skill size and references

```bash
skill-benchmark profile-skill ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --format markdown \
  --out skill-profile.md
```

`profile-skill` reports `SKILL.md` token estimates, reference-file counts/sizes, heading/module counts, and warnings for overly broad or oversized skills. These warnings are advisory; focused 2–3-module skills are often easier for agents to apply, but large skills can be justified when references are conditional.

## Token overhead

`token-overhead` combines static skill profile data with paired runtime traces. It reports the static `SKILL.md`/reference footprint, `with_skill - without_skill` token deltas, objective lift, objective lift per 1k extra total tokens — and, when cost telemetry exists, `with - without` dollar deltas, objective lift per dollar, and the total spend on saturated/no-lift pairs. It grades the runs through the same benchmark path, so a manifest with judge assertions needs `--judge-results <verdicts.jsonl>`; without the verdicts the grading stays incomplete and the lift is withheld as partial coverage.

```bash
skill-benchmark token-overhead ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs-subdir eval-runs/latest \
  --format markdown \
  --out token-overhead.md

skill-benchmark token-overhead \
  ../skill-a/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  ../skill-b/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs-subdir eval-runs/trace-smoke \
  --out token-overhead.json
```

If a repo has no paired runs, the report is `partial` and withholds its headline: the top-level `summary` and each report's `summary` read `null` for the static footprint and the runtime-pair count, and the observed values (the static token counts, `runtime_pairs: 0`) sit under `summary.observed`. Each report's `profile` block still carries the static footprint. The markdown table prints `—` in every cell of that skill's row. The decision loop that reads these numbers is [`is-my-skill-worth-its-tokens.md`](is-my-skill-worth-its-tokens.md).

## Suite preflight / allowlisted multi-skill tiers

Use `suite-run` before expensive model calls. It reads only an explicit suite file, rejects unrelated top-level manifests under the workspace root, verifies optional tree-hash pins, prints row estimates, and writes `RUN_SCOPE.json`.

```bash
skill-benchmark suite-run examples/adewale-workspace/all-manifests.txt \
  --workspace-root ../updating_all_of_my_skills \
  --pins examples/skill-pins.json \
  --tier preflight \
  --out-dir suite-runs/preflight

skill-benchmark suite-run examples/adewale-workspace/all-manifests.txt \
  --workspace-root ../updating_all_of_my_skills \
  --pins examples/skill-pins.json \
  --tier prepare \
  --include-ablations \
  --out-dir suite-runs/prepare
```

Non-model tiers are `preflight`, `static`, `prepare`, and `jetty-dry-run`. By default, a stray manifest such as `beautiful-mermaid/evals/shared-benchmark.json` fails the run instead of silently entering the matrix; pass `--allow-extra-manifests` only for exploratory audits.

## Aggregate many skills

```bash
skill-benchmark aggregate \
  $(cat examples/adewale-workspace/all-manifests.txt) \
  --runs-root .. \
  --runs-subdir eval-runs/latest \
  --out aggregate-benchmark.json
```

## Export Anthropic-compatible benchmark

```bash
skill-benchmark export-anthropic ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --out benchmark.anthropic.json
```

## Blind comparison

```bash
skill-benchmark compare-tasks ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --out compare-tasks.jsonl \
  --truth-out compare-truth.json

skill-benchmark compare-results \
  --truth compare-truth.json \
  --results compare-results.jsonl \
  --out compare-summary.json
```

## Materialize ablations

`materialize-ablations` writes real, altered skill trees for the manifest's declared removal ablations, plus a provenance record. The mechanism table and correctness gates are [`skill-ablation-spec.md`](skill-ablation-spec.md); the [README's Ablations section](../README.md#ablations) covers routing.

```bash
skill-benchmark materialize-ablations ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --out-dir ablated --out ablated/provenance.json
```

## Review viewer (static or served)

```bash
skill-benchmark render-viewer \
  --benchmark benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --out review.html
```

The viewer embeds run artifacts (images inline, typed links for pdf/xlsx, text in place). `--previous-workspace <dir>` embeds a diff against that iteration's `benchmark.json` (per-variant deltas, per-case deltas, new/resolved flags; pair with the `iteration-N/` directory convention). `--serve --port 8642` hosts the review with a feedback form that writes `feedback.json` under `--workspace` (default: the benchmark's directory).

The form takes case id, model, variant, run number, an optional judge assertion name, a verdict (`pass`, `fail`, `unsure`, or none), and a note. Naming an assertion makes the entry a [`judge-alignment`](#validate-a-judge-against-human-labels-judge-alignment) label; leaving it blank annotates the whole run for [`error-analysis --feedback`](#error-analysis-open-coding--axial-taxonomy). The file is the one store for human judgements:

```json
{"schema_version": 2, "entries": [
  {"case_id": "pos-security-meaningless-test", "variant": "with_skill", "run_number": 2,
   "assertion": "qualitative-review", "verdict": "fail", "note": "Praises the weak test."}
]}
```

Each entry is `{case_id, variant, run_number, model?, assertion?, verdict?, note?}` and needs a verdict, a note, or both; `variant` must be a real arm (`with_skill`, `without_skill`, `old_skill`, or `ablation:<id>`), because the entry's run is the same `RunCoordinate` that judge tasks and result rows use; `run_number` defaults to 1, and the `good`/`bad` verdicts of the first form are read as `pass`/`fail`. A later entry for the same run and assertion replaces the earlier one. An invalid new entry gets HTTP 400 and leaves the file unchanged; an old entry that no longer validates is kept verbatim under `unparsed_entries` and ignored by the readers.

## Trigger matrix (activation across agents and models)

```bash
skill-trigger-matrix ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --agent claude \
  --runs-per-query 3 \
  --out trigger-matrix.json
```

For each (agent, model) cell this mounts the skill where that agent discovers skills autonomously (never forcing the load), runs the manifest's `kind: "trigger"` cases the requested number of times, and reports per-cell trigger rates split by should-fire / should-not-fire polarity. The `claude` adapter spawns headless Claude Code subagents and defaults to haiku, sonnet, and opus, and counts a `Skill` tool call as loading when it carries either the skill's declared `name` or the directory the skill is mounted under (Claude Code 2.1.269 invokes project skills by that directory name; every adapter mounts a skill under its own directory name, `demo` for `skills/demo/SKILL.md`, the name a user's install shows); `--agent codex`, `--agent pi`, `--agent vibe`, and the offline `--agent stub` are included. Codex keeps credential-bearing `CODEX_HOME` outside the model workdir, exposes only `$CODEX_HOME/skills` as an extra read root, and reads the CLI's explicit user-role `<skill>` injection from the session rollout under that home. Tool calls, outputs, and skill listings in the rollout do not count as loads. When no rollout injection exists, the JSON stream's completed path evidence decides the result. Rows record `codex_rollout_status` and the evidence kind. Pi keeps its `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` outside the workdir the same way, and so does the Claude adapter's isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, which holds the copied OAuth credentials; Claude rows record `claude_config_outside_workdir`. The Claude adapter isolates its config whenever authentication is portable: a credentials file it can copy, or a login in the environment (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`). An isolated run drops `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS`, so organisation skills do not compete with the one under test, and every Claude row lists the other skills Claude Code's init event offered the model as `competing_skills`. A keychain login cannot move into a fresh config, so such runs keep the user's own config, record `config_isolated: false` with a `config_isolation_warning`, and `trigger-compare` blocks their cells. The Vibe adapter mounts skills under `.agents/skills`, keeps `VIBE_HOME` outside the model workdir, runs `vibe --prompt "$QUERY" --output streaming`, and detects native `skill` tool calls by the same two names with path-evidence fallback. Vibe's stream changed shape in 2.23: 2.22 and earlier write one `LLMMessage` per line (`role`, string `content`, `tool_calls`), 2.23 and later write public history entries (`type` `message`, `effect`, `notice`, ...; message `content` is a list of blocks, and one `effect` entry is a finished tool call). The Vibe trace dialect, used by `run-agent --agent vibe` and this adapter, picks the parser from the stream's first record; in the newer shape a `notice` or `checkpoint` entry may follow the final answer ([fixtures](../tests/fixtures/vibe/README.md), built from Vibe 2.25.8's source). Additional agents add their `AgentAdapter` with an explicit `skill_name_source` for the name their CLI emits, explicit trace-dialect semantics, and one complete `agent_capabilities.BACKENDS` row; `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` and `ADAPTERS` are projections rather than independent registration points. The tuning loop that consumes these rates is [`tuning-skill-activation.md`](tuning-skill-activation.md); manual live smoke tests wrap the same path (`RUN_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1` for Claude, `RUN_CODEX_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1` for Codex, `RUN_PI_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1` for Pi, `RUN_VIBE_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1` for Vibe). For a cheaper auth/network/process check that invokes every supported live adapter/model without asserting trigger behavior, run `RUN_AGENT_INVOKE_SMOKE=1 python3 -m unittest tests.test_trigger_matrix.AgentInvokeSmokeTests -v`.

The `claude`, `codex`, and `pi` adapters hide the operator's host skills, agents, instruction files, and MCP servers from a trigger run and keep the mounted skill visible. Each row records the flags as `context_isolation`. [Trigger context isolation](agent-parity.md#trigger-context-isolation) lists the flags per agent and what they remove. Trigger results recorded before this change had host skills visible, so re-run them before comparing.

## Pi trigger evals

```bash
skill-pi-trigger-eval ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --split tune \
  --runs-per-query 3 \
  --out trigger-report.json
```

This is `skill-trigger-matrix --agent pi` with Pi's defaults (one optional `--model`; `--timeout` defaults to the matrix's 240 seconds, so a report from either entry point pairs with one from the other in `trigger-compare`), and it writes the same report. The Pi adapter creates an isolated `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` beside Pi's working directory, not inside it, seeded with auth only. It mounts the skill under that directory's `skills/`, runs Pi with `--no-skills --skill <that skills dir>` to list only mounted skills, without forcing their load, and detects whether the model loaded the skill from JSON stream events. Because Pi runs with read, grep, find and ls, keeping its home out of the working directory means the copied auth cannot be read from there and the skill is reachable only through Pi's own discovery; rows record `pi_home_outside_workdir`. `--ablation` and `--trace-runs` work as they do for the matrix; traces land in a `matrix-*` directory under `--trace-runs`.

## Trigger comparison (paired causal evidence for activation)

A single trigger-matrix report is a raw single-arm measurement — it steers description edits, but it cannot confirm that an ablation *caused* a discovery regression. `trigger-compare` pairs a baseline matrix report with an `--ablation` matrix report of the **same canonical skill revision** and emits the trigger population's version of the answer path's causal-confirmation verdict:

```bash
skill-trigger-matrix evals/shared-benchmark.json --agent claude --out baseline.json
skill-trigger-matrix evals/shared-benchmark.json --agent claude --ablation drop-description --out ablated.json
skill-benchmark trigger-compare --baseline baseline.json --ablation ablated.json --out trigger-comparison.json
```

Rows are re-validated through the typed trigger-observation contract (a row whose stored flags contradict the contract is rejected, never averaged). Reports declare the complete expected agent/model/query design, and every repetition carries a stable `(query_id, run_number)`: a missing whole cell, a short or duplicate repetition set, or a row outside the design makes the report malformed. Each report also carries a self-digested `manifest_identity`, a self-digested experimental `protocol` (producer/adapter and executable identities, model/flags, timeout, repetition count, and worker concurrency), and each row repeats the protocol digest plus observed isolation state. Missing or mismatched identity/protocol fields are a compatibility error; regenerate legacy reports with the current runner rather than comparing them. Cross-arm protocol or observed-isolation drift makes causal provenance unverified or blocks the affected cell.

Comparison then forms complete (agent, model, query-ID) cells and collapses every agent/model cell for the same authored query ID and polarity into one **pass-rate** delta. The authored query is the inference unit: adding models or agents cannot multiply one query into significance. Pass rates make polarity inherent, so a should-not-trigger query regresses by over-triggering. The verdict goes through the `EvidenceClass` guard: `confirmed_causal` requires matching top-level and recorded ablation IDs, verified revision provenance, complete coverage with no blocked cells, a negative aggregate mean pass delta, and a sign-flip-significant drop across authored queries (≥ 6 consistently regressed queries, same discretization bound as the answer path). A negative but insignificant mean reports `indeterminate`; a non-negative mean cannot confirm a regression even if the two-sided test is significant. Cross-arm design mismatches or incomplete observations are listed as blocked cells with reasons and make the whole verdict indeterminate.

## Jetty adapter

Jetty support is optional and validated against production `flows-api.jetty.io` (live smoke first passed 2026-07-17; captured response fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/jetty/` — see [`jetty-support-spec.md`](jetty-support-spec.md)). The harness exports runbook-mode chat-completion payloads, Jetty executes them, and `import-jetty-results` copies `output.md`, artifacts, and metadata back into the normal run layout. `run-jetty` zips each task's upload plan (Jetty's sandbox upload flattens single files to basenames; a zip auto-extracts under `/app/assets/` with paths preserved), submits with a short `timeout_hint` so polling drives the wait, and downloads every `/app/results` artifact from trajectory storage before writing the run record. Provider status aliases parse into queued/running/succeeded/failed/timed-out/protocol-invalid states; unknown status and completed-without-`output.md` fail closed as protocol-invalid rather than ordinary model failures. Imports validate every record, destination, embedded answer design, model-visible task digest, and uploaded-file digest before committing the batch; one invalid record leaves all destination run directories untouched.

Every live invocation requires `--out`, exclusively locks its attempt journal, and atomically checkpoints `prepared`, upload completion, submission acknowledgement, terminal provider observation, artifact download, and result publication. The default journal path is `<out>.attempts.json`; `--journal PATH` selects another location. Journal aliases resolve to one canonical identity, hard-linked journals and symlinked lock files are rejected, and the separate `<journal>.lock` file is intentionally retained while its OS lock is released automatically when the process exits or crashes. The identity contains the full attested task contract plus its digest, collection, task, and model, so a stale or mismatched receipt fails closed. Provider submit/poll responses are reduced to allowlisted causal receipts before persistence. Rerunning the same command resumes an acknowledged trajectory without another `POST /v1/chat/completions`, and a terminal receipt resumes download/import. A local polling deadline leaves the attempt acknowledged, emits a nonterminal record, exits nonzero, and is rejected by `import-jetty-results`; the next invocation polls the same ID again.

A process or connection failure, unusable acknowledgement, or HTTP status not documented as rejection-before-execution while the POST acknowledgement is pending becomes `submission_unknown`: it is visible in both the journal and result record, exits nonzero, cannot be imported, and is not retried. Only Jetty's documented 429 rejection returns to the automatically submit-ready state. After reconciling the provider manually, `--resubmit-unknown` explicitly abandons that unknown receipt and submits again. Jetty currently exposes no server-side idempotency key, so this override can duplicate a paid run; the harness deliberately does not claim exactly-once execution in that ambiguous window. Before replacing output on restart, the harness reconstructs every downloaded or committed record from the journal, so interruption cannot regress previously committed JSONL. File replacement is process-crash-safe on supported platforms; parent-directory syncing remains best-effort where the OS does not expose directory `fsync`.

```bash
# Export runbook-mode Jetty chat-completion payloads. No network calls.
skill-benchmark export-jetty ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \

Add `--journal jetty-attempts.json` when an explicit journal path is useful.
Do not use `--resubmit-unknown` until you have checked whether Jetty accepted
the ambiguous attempt.

Defaults follow Jetty docs and `jettyio/jettyio-skills`: `claude-code`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `model_provider=anthropic`, and `snapshot=python312-uv`. The runbook is the system message. Runtime values go in `jetty.template_variables`; every model-visible file reference is a deterministic `/app/assets/...` path baked at export time. `jetty.file_paths` carries the one run-time value — the uploaded zip bundle's storage path from `POST /api/v1/sandbox/upload`. Use `JETTY_BASE_URL` to override `https://flows-api.jetty.io`.

Opt-in live smoke (five real sandbox runs — fixture-free, fixture-backed, and a forced server-side failure; never in default CI):

```bash
RUN_JETTY_SMOKE=1 JETTY_API_TOKEN=... JETTY_SMOKE_COLLECTION=<your-collection> \
  python3 -m unittest discover tests -k smoke_jetty -v
```
