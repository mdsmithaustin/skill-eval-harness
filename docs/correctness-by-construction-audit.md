# Correctness-by-construction audit

This audit records the invariants that are now enforced structurally at the harness's trust
boundaries. Raw provider/task/result dictionaries remain wire formats; code parses them into frozen,
closed domain values before it makes execution, grading, comparison, or causal claims.

## Construction rule

```text
untrusted wire data
  -> strict parser / smart constructor
  -> one closed domain variant
  -> derived booleans and numeric claims
  -> validated persisted row
```

The rule has three consequences:

1. mutually exclusive states are variants, not independently writable booleans;
2. identities and units are validated before values are paired or aggregated; and
3. persisted JSON is parsed again when it crosses back into the process.

## Autonomous-trigger observations

The trigger path has one internal state pipeline:

```text
subprocess bytes
  -> InvocationOutcome
  -> PiStream (Pi only)
  -> TriggerDetection
  -> TriggerObservation
  -> CompleteTriggerResult | CompleteSkillTriggerResult | IncompleteTriggerResult
  -> CompleteTriggerCohort | IncompleteTriggerCohort | EmptyTriggerCohort
  -> persisted JSON row
```

- `InvocationOutcome` is a frozen, closed state machine. Completion, timeout, spawn failure,
  process failure, provider failure, protocol failure, and harness failure are mutually exclusive.
- `PiStream` parses provider status and cumulative telemetry together. A complete process with a
  terminal provider error, malformed JSON stream, or no final non-retrying `agent_end` is failed.
  Failed streams cannot carry numeric usage or cost.
- `TriggerDetection.triggered` is derived from typed evidence. Unknown lifecycle events are not
  evidence, and callers cannot independently set a trigger boolean.
- `TriggerObservation.result` is a sum type. `CompleteTriggerResult` scores legacy activation.
  `CompleteSkillTriggerResult` requires every expected skill and excludes every forbidden skill.
  Both complete variants carry `passed` and `triggered`. `IncompleteTriggerResult` carries the
  failed invocation state. The compatibility `passed` projection is `bool | None`.
- Scoped attribution records typed evidence for each selected source identity. Persisted scope,
  activated identities, missing expected identities, and forbidden activations must agree with
  that evidence. Both runners keep the full catalog mounted and hashed.
- `trigger_reporting.py` owns every raw trigger aggregate: overall report, matrix cell, polarity,
  and per-query. Only `CompleteTriggerCohort` has `pass_rate` and `trigger_rate`; incomplete and
  empty cohorts cannot serialize a numeric quality rate. Both trigger runners retain
  `TriggerObservation` values until this aggregation is complete and serialize rows last.
- Incomplete rows expose raw evidence separately but serialize measured `pass` and `triggered` as
  null. Reports name observed/attempted coverage and incomplete reasons, terminal output names the
  cohort `INCOMPLETE`, and the CLI exits nonzero.
- Incomplete observations cannot carry measured usage or cost.
- Persisted rows are parsed through `TriggerObservation.from_row` before live smoke trusts them.

Recorded, sanitized Pi JSONL fixtures cover success, an exit-zero provider error, retry then
success, and exhausted retries. Exhaustive finite-state and trigger truth tables guard the boundary.

## Paired experimental identity

`experimental_pairs.py` owns `ExperimentalPairKey(case_id, model, run_number, population)`, one
explicit `ContrastSpec`, and the only constructor for `ExperimentalPair`.

- A complete pair contains exactly one treatment and one control arm from its declared contrast,
  with the same key. The default contrast retains the existing `with_skill`/`without_skill` wire
  shape and compatibility properties.
- Each contrast binds both arms to canonical activation, skill-set, and content-revision factor
  coordinates. Native discovery and component-composition work can therefore add declared binary
  contrasts without pretending those dimensions are ordinary execution variants.
- Missing arms and ineligible arms become explicit `BlockedExperimentalPair` values that retain the
  `contrast_id`. Pairing diagnostics serialize the same ID; the durable comparison identity is
  `(contrast_id, pair_key)`.
- A duplicate arm for one identity raises before aggregation; it can no longer overwrite an earlier
  row in a dictionary.
- Lift, graded lift, paired reliability, paired cost, token-overhead run discovery, slice/case
  comparative flags, readiness comparisons, and answer-population ablation confirmation consume the
  validated construction. Pairing diagnostics expose eligible/blocked counts and reasons.
- Telemetry comparisons add the stricter measurement-basis check (including provenance, currency,
  billing scope, and recorded revision fields) before a numeric delta or ratio exists.

This prevents cross-model, cross-repetition, and cross-population rows from contributing to a value
called paired. Older result rows without a model remain in the explicit unlabeled-model population;
a missing repetition identity is rejected rather than inferred from file order.

## Answer-runner outcomes

`runner_contracts.py` replaces the mutable answer-runner outcome bag with the frozen union:

```text
Completed | TimedOut | SpawnFailed | ProviderFailed
```

`OutcomeContext` owns the closed provider enum, recursively freezes JSON-shaped context, and
validates finite non-negative elapsed time, usage, and cost. `Completed` requires a non-blank,
strict-UTF-8 final answer; raw trace bytes are never promoted to candidate output. Return codes 124
and 127 are conventional serialized codes for harness timeout and spawn failure, but a real spawned
process may also exit with either code; the explicit `invocation_state` discriminant preserves that
provenance. `ProviderFailed` preserves the subprocess's actual exit code, including zero when the
process succeeded but its provider envelope was malformed or lacked a final answer;
provider-response failure is not encoded by inventing return code 1. `write_runner_outcome`
exhaustively adapts the union to artifacts; backends cannot repair or mutate status booleans while
writing files. `RunnerOutcome` remains only as a strict compatibility factory that constructs one
of the four variants.

A `Completed` outcome also carries completion evidence in its frozen `OutcomeContext` metadata,
because an exit-zero answer can still be cut off or come from another model.
`completion_contracts.py` owns three values: `StopObservation` maps a provider's stop reason into
the closed `StopClass` (`completed`, `truncated`, `turn_limit`, `refused`, `other`, `unobserved`)
and keeps the raw value; `ServedModel` compares the reported model with the requested one
(`match`, `mismatch`, `unverifiable`, `unobserved`, `not-requested`); and `EffortSetting` records
the requested level or `backend-default`. The shared writer fills `unobserved` and
`backend-default` when a backend reports nothing, so a run without evidence stays distinct from a
run that predates the fields. `execution_valid` treats a `truncated` or `turn_limit` stop and a
served-model `mismatch` as unscorable, so the run blocks its pair; a refusal stays graded and is
counted in the report's `run_endings` block. *Update (2026-09-30): these values are now spelled `unavailable` (was `unobserved`), `not_requested` (was `not-requested`) and `backend_default` (was `backend-default`), and the served-model check gained `mixed`; [`vocabulary.md`](vocabulary.md#run-artifacts) owns the current values.*

## Judge invocation results

`judge_contracts.JudgeInvocation` is the immutable process boundary shared by native judge
backends and `--judge-cmd`. It requires string output channels, an exact integer return code, and an
explicit shared `InvocationState`,
validates finite non-negative cost and usage measurements, recursively freezes usage, and closes
usage provenance plus model identity. `run_one_judge_task` rejects any registered backend that
returns another shape before JSON extraction, schema checks, typed verdict construction, or row
assembly. Exit-zero provider-protocol failure retains return code zero with
`InvocationState.PROVIDER_FAILED`; it cannot become a complete judge observation. A nonzero exit
remains a valid diagnostic invocation but cannot become a complete judge
observation. This changes no persisted judge-row fields; `judge_verdict.py` still re-establishes the
boolean/scored/dimension/dynamic/consensus invariant at the storage boundary.

## Gemini CLI provider boundary

The Gemini integration reuses the existing typed process and answer/judge boundaries, while adding
a provider-specific wire contract at the point where Gemini's JSON or JSONL leaves the subprocess.

```text
InvocationRequest
  -> ProcessInvocationPlan
  -> InvocationResult
  -> GeminiStream | GeminiJsonResponse
  -> Completed | ProviderFailed        (answer)
  -> JudgeInvocation                    (judge)
```

- `InvocationRequest` is a validated minimal answer request: prompt, optional model, positive timeout,
  and working directory. Provider adapters refine it into a frozen `ProcessInvocationPlan` containing
  argv, stdin, cwd, timeout, and environment; the sole internal subprocess owner accepts that plan,
  including version probes. Provider-specific auth and policy remain adapter-owned inputs to plan
  construction. The Gemini adapter accepts one caller-trusted executable token and owns output-format,
  policy, trust, conditional sandbox, workspace expansion, session, extension, and prompt/model
  flags. Prefix launchers are rejected because they can reinterpret appended arguments; the chosen
  executable itself remains an explicit operator authority recorded in artifacts.
- `gemini_contracts.py` reads external Gemini CLI JSON with last-value-wins handling for duplicate
  keys, while finite typed provider contracts and every harness-authored or validated artifact stay strict.
  Stream success requires one `init`, one terminal successful `result`, a non-empty final assistant
  message, paired tool start/result identifiers, and no provider error. Usage is numeric only when
  Gemini supplies a valid token accounting object. A malformed exit-zero envelope therefore becomes
  `ProviderFailed`, never a successful answer with guessed telemetry.
- Gemini tool records are adapted through the shared `TraceDialect`; the adapter preserves lifecycle
  identifiers and does not invent an equality between event count and Gemini's aggregate
  `stats.tool_calls`. This is the right abstraction level for normalized evidence, but it does not
  imply that every provider exposes identical counters. In particular, `read_many_files.include`
  is request intent, and Gemini omits the processed-file list from `stream-json`, so it cannot prove
  a skill read.
- The isolated Gemini settings disable ordinary local `.env` discovery, while early workspace trust
  remains unset so ancestor `.gemini/.env` files are skipped before `--skip-trust` takes effect.
  Environment construction preserves only variables required by the selected auth plan while
  removing inherited sandbox, system-prompt, extension, IDE, debug, endpoint, telemetry, and custom
  system-settings controls. Explicit ADC is copied outside the model workspace; a model-readable ADC
  source is rejected. Default machine administrator settings and policy may still exist, and artifacts
  state that limitation instead of claiming they were isolated.
- The planned auth mode also owns containment feasibility. Machine system settings may still override
  user-tier auth fields, so artifacts disclose that limitation rather than claiming the planned mode
  is necessarily the effective provider mode. Gemini's container hop cannot transport OAuth
  GCA access tokens or decrypt host-bound FileKeychain state; legacy `oauth_creds.json` and
  explicit ADC are portable, while implicit ADC is unproven there. The adapter requests the nested
  sandbox only for a proven transport and otherwise records why it was disabled, while retaining
  deny policy plus config/workspace isolation.
- Runtime metadata records the installed CLI version and the pinned fixture contract revision, so
  a future protocol drift failure can be attributed instead of guessed. Requested, configured,
  and resolved model identities remain separate; zero/many reported models never become one.
- The answer adapter constructs the closed `RunnerOutcome` union and the judge adapter constructs
  `JudgeInvocation`. The latter retains immutable raw provider response and provider metadata
  sidecars, which prevents provider dictionaries from leaking into verdict construction while still
  preserving provider evidence. Gemini judges use the lifecycle-bearing stream and reject any
  observed tool lifecycle, with the independent aggregate counter as a secondary failure signal.
  Active `@path` preprocessing and leading slash-command prompts are rejected before spawn, closing
  the provider's pre-stream read/command channel. Administrator policy can still override user-tier
  policy, so artifacts continue to disclose that separate limitation.
- The existing trigger adapter abstraction is deliberately not used for Gemini yet. Gemini's
  `activate_skill` is an interactive tool and the headless default policy denies it; without a live,
  non-interactive activation proof, declaring trigger support would turn absence of evidence into a
  false-negative measurement. The registry therefore advertises answer, judge, trace, and usage
  support, but not trigger or cost support.

The remaining compatibility seam is the internal dictionary returned by `gemini_cli_invoke`; it is
not a public or persisted contract, and both consumers immediately construct the closed domain value
for their path. A future common provider-invocation result could remove that local adaptation, but
doing so is not required to make the Gemini wire, answer, judge, or persisted boundaries type-safe.

## Orthogonal run evidence and artifact commit

This section describes ordinary answer artifacts.
Recovery rows through `run-agent` or its `run-codex` and `run-claude` wrappers retain `recovery.json` and raw snapshots instead of the ordinary artifact commit, workspace-diff, grading, and normalized paired telemetry contracts.
The [recovery reference](recovery.md) defines their separate evidence limits and consumer responsibilities.

`telemetry.ObservationEvidence` is the product of four independent states:

```text
process × provider_response × trace × artifact_set
where each state is complete | incomplete | unknown
```

Operation evidence is derived and complete only when process, provider response, and trace are all
complete. Completing one axis never promotes another. `write_trace_artifacts` owns trace derivation
and rejects caller extras that collide with any derived evidence field. Provider adapters may retain
usage/cost from a valid provider envelope independently of trace availability.

New ordinary answer-runner and Jetty directories declare artifact contract version 1 and write
`artifact-commit.json` last. The marker lists the required files plus a SHA-256 inventory. Readers
verify the marker and inventory before deriving `artifact_set_complete`; an interrupted write,
missing or changed committed file, unsafe inventory path, or stale marker remains incomplete and
unscorable. Later downstream artifacts such as `grading.json` do not alter the committed producer
inventory.

## Grading observations and judge tasks

`grading_contracts.py` closes both sides of qualitative grading:

```text
assertion row -> Satisfied | Failed | Unavailable | Skipped
judge work item -> JudgeTask(case, model, variant, run, paths, prompt, fingerprints)
```

- `passed: null` is unavailable evidence, not a behavioral failure. Dependency skips remain a
  separate state even when an assertion had already produced an observed result before the
  dependency fixed point resolved.
- Severity and oracle tier are enums and scores are finite. Only satisfied/failed observations can
  enter grading denominators; aggregation consumes the union and serializes dictionaries last.
- `JudgeTask` validates the exact experimental identity, fingerprint syntax, and run paths before
  the task is queued; `run_one_judge_task` recomputes the canonical input fingerprint against the
  current output and trajectory before invocation. Assertion and conversation JSON are recursively frozen and
  detached from their source rows, then deeply thawed only at serialization. A partially assembled
  task cannot reach a judge backend.
- `ty` checks exhaustive narrowing for the assertion union and precise judge-task identity fields.

## Imported judge verdicts

`judge_verdict.py` parses judge rows into one of:

```text
BooleanVerdict | ScoredVerdict | DimensionVerdict | DynamicVerdict | ConsensusVerdict
```

- `passed` is a real JSON boolean; strings and integer truthiness are rejected.
- Scored verdicts derive pass from finite `score >= threshold` and reject a contradictory stored
  boolean.
- Dimension verdicts validate non-empty names, the 1–5 score range, normalized aggregate, and
  threshold; when merged against an assertion, the supplied names must exactly match its declared
  dimension set.
- Dynamic verdicts require uniquely named boolean criteria, a valid minimum, and an aggregate that
  agrees with the criteria.
- Stored result loading rejects missing, conflicting, and duplicate task IDs. Repetition/panel
  merging requires one task identity; panel models must be non-empty and unique. Consensus is
  serialized as its own verdict kind.
- Provider output that violates schema or semantic invariants is retained only as diagnostic raw
  payload; both report and strict modes store one valid failed boolean verdict.

Human verdicts cross their own boundary. `human_judgements.HumanJudgement` parses each
`feedback.json` entry into a run coordinate, an optional judge assertion, a closed
`pass | fail | unsure` verdict, and a note, and rejects an entry with neither verdict nor note.
`judge-alignment` derives a label only from a pass/fail verdict on a named assertion, so a run-level
note or an `unsure` cannot become ground truth.

## Draft versus executable tasks

`PreparedTaskDraft` is the permissive planning value. It can render or inspect a partial task but
cannot be passed to a runner. `PreparedTaskDraft.validate()` / `PreparedTask.from_row()` is the only
transition to executable `PreparedTask`.

The executable type requires non-empty identifiers, a closed split and execution variant, an
explicit positive integer repetition, list-of-string path fields, a safe non-root relative run
directory, no skill paths on `without_skill`, and matching typed ablation provenance/tree identity. Runner boundaries convert
constructor failures to explicit CLI input errors instead of starting a subprocess. The author-facing
case `kind` remains descriptive; the closed execution population is derived separately as answer or
trigger.

## Jetty lifecycle

`jetty_contracts.py` maps provider aliases once into the closed lifecycle:

```text
Queued | Running | Succeeded | Failed | TimedOut | ProtocolInvalid
```

The poller, executor, importer, trace writer, and normalized metadata consume that state. Timeout is
not an ordinary provider failure, and success requires a non-empty trajectory identity. Unknown/missing states and a stored lifecycle discriminator that
conflicts with the compatibility `status` field become `ProtocolInvalid`. A completed trajectory is
successful only when it also contains `output.md`; completed-without-output therefore fails closed as
a protocol error and cannot receive return code zero.

Dry-run payload generation is planning, not a Jetty execution lifecycle. Non-executable submitted
payloads are protocol-invalid rather than ordinary provider failures.

## Persisted run artifacts

Persisted run evidence crosses a typed disk boundary before event semantics are inspected:

```text
artifact-commit.json -> Legacy | MissingCommit | InvalidCommit | Incomplete | Complete
events.json -> Missing | Invalid | Loaded
```

- `artifact_contracts.py` verifies the declared schema, required-file inventory, paths, symbolic
  links, and SHA-256 digests. It preserves malformed marker data separately from a well-formed but
  partial or stale artifact set.
- `trace_contracts.parse_event_log` validates the event-log envelope and performs the explicit v1
  compatibility adaptation. A JSON `null` document is invalid rather than being mistaken for a
  missing file.
- `artifact_commit_valid` and `read_events_base` remain compatibility projections; integrity and
  grading code can consume the closed observations without interpreting booleans or error tuples.

## Normalized trace-event lifecycle

`trace_contracts.py` owns `EventState`:

```text
COMPLETED | IN_PROGRESS | FAILED | UNKNOWN
```

`parse_event_state` records whether state came from provider status, an intrinsically terminal/start
event kind, explicit legacy adaptation, or remained unknown. Missing/misspelled status is never
optimistically completed. Command grading, tool/file counts, skill-invocation metrics, and retry
logic consume completed events only. Start/end fixture pairs prove a real operation counts once;
unknown lifecycle records cannot become phantom tool calls.

## Human-text comparison

Human-readable answer matching has one internal state pipeline:

```text
raw output string
  -> ComparisonText(raw, rendered-v1, changes)
       |-> LiteralTextAssertion | RegexTextAssertion -> MatchObservation ---------|
       `-> SimilarityTextAssertion -> SimilarityObservation / SimilarityDecision -|
                                                                                   `-> derived verdict and normalization evidence
```

- `output.md` remains the faithful artifact. `ComparisonText` creates a separate immutable view;
  no matcher can normalize the evidence on disk.
- `ComparisonProfile` is closed over `exact` and the versioned `rendered-v1`. The latter applies
  NFC and removes only zero-width controls whose removal does not reorder visible glyphs (`U+200B`,
  `U+2060`, and `U+FEFF`). It deliberately preserves direction-changing bidi controls, soft
  hyphens, joiners, Unicode line/paragraph separators, invisible mathematical operators, variation
  selectors, and emoji tag characters rather than treating every `Cf` character alike.
- Literal, regex, and similarity assertion dictionaries cross one strict parser. Missing/empty or
  rendered-empty operands, conflicting alias fields, scalar value lists, non-boolean `ci`, invalid
  regexes, normalization-unstable regex source, unknown comparison modes, and non-finite/out-of-range
  thresholds cannot become executable assertions. The legacy list-valued `value` alias remains valid
  for the multi-value literal assertions when `values` is absent.
- Positive and negative assertions derive their verdicts from the same match/negation observation;
  similarity verdicts derive from a finite 0-1 ratio rounded to the same four-decimal score that is
  published in results. A zero-width character therefore cannot make `regex` spuriously fail while
  making `not_regex` spuriously pass, and contradictory score/verdict fields are not constructor
  inputs. External embedding vectors reject boolean/non-finite elements before cosine construction;
  negative cosine occupies the public score domain's 0.0 floor.
- Every rendered-v1 regex verdict uses exact-pinned `regex==2026.7.19` in `VERSION0`
  compatibility mode under one monotonic 0.25-second budget, so inserting a removable control
  cannot switch regex engines or Unicode character-class semantics. When normalization changes the
  candidate, the normalized search and optional raw diagnostic share that budget. Expiry, resource
  exhaustion, or a non-CPython implementation constructs unavailable evidence rather than letting a
  synthesized candidate produce a negative pass. `comparison: "exact"` retains stdlib behavior. The
  bounded path works in worker threads and owns no process-global timer or handler; it adds no
  subprocess, model, or network call.
- Results identify the comparison profile. When normalization changes an operand, the result also
  records the affected code points, the raw deterministic similarity score where applicable, and
  whether normalization changed a deterministic verdict. Embedding mode records that last value as
  unknown (`null`) rather than paying for a second external embedding call.
- Prompt leakage, held-out-rubric leakage, canary detection, and answer-key n-gram overlap consume
  the same human-text view, including minimum-length and non-vacuity decisions. Protocol and
  machine-identity checks (`golden_output` by default, structured JSON, scripts, command text, tool
  names, and paths) remain exact; graded script scores still cross a finite 0-1 numeric boundary.
- The project's `ty` gate automatically includes every packaged top-level Python module,
  repository script, shipped example, and explicit static contract assertion under `type_tests/`.
  Constructors, closed unions, return types, and exhaustive consumers are therefore checked without
  a per-module registration step, and warnings fail CI. Runtime tests remain executable negative
  proofs: many deliberately pass malformed values that production types forbid. The gate
  complements rather than replaces runtime parsing; manifest dictionaries and external
  embedding/script values remain untrusted wire data. The complete inventory and extension rule
  are in [`typed-python.md`](typed-python.md).
- Packaging inventory, `ty` source coverage, and the versioned trigger-semantic module inventory
  are separate contracts. A standalone report-only module is excluded from trigger identity, while
  a declared trigger dependency changes `harness_identity` and blocks causal reuse. The inventory is
  deliberately conservative at module granularity: because `skill_benchmark.py` still owns both
  trigger and non-trigger orchestration, any edit to that monolith invalidates trigger evidence.
- The command line crosses the same kind of boundary. `argparse.Namespace` becomes a frozen
  `ValidatedLegacyCLIInvocation`; commands form a closed enum, paths and domain identities are projected to their
  typed values, numeric limits reject booleans and non-finite/out-of-range values, and dispatch
  requires exactly one owner for every command. Existing handlers still cross one explicitly named
  legacy Namespace adapter; these projections are a migration seam until each handler accepts its
  command-specific typed options.

## Report coverage cohorts

Variant and slice summaries consume one closed report population:

```text
attempted rows + stable identity + eligibility -> Empty | Complete | Partial | NotApplicable
row cohort + metric key/applicability -> metric-specific cohort
observed numeric rate -> UnitRate(0 <= value <= 1)
```

- Empty populations remain distinct from fully observed non-empty populations.
- Attempts that exist but have no applicable denominator remain distinct from empty and blocked
  populations.
- A partial population owns the attempted, observed, and blocked counts plus its reason. Its
  observed means remain diagnostics while headline means are unavailable.
- Every row is classified once from the attempted sequence, carries a stable run identity, is
  recursively frozen, and cannot repeat that identity. No membership rule depends on object `id()`.
- Each rate gets its own refined cohort. A complete row set with one absent rate is metric-partial,
  never permission to average only the surviving values.
- Rate validation rejects bool, NaN, infinity, and out-of-range values before aggregation.
- `ty` checks exhaustive narrowing across all four coverage states.

## Ablation provenance vocabulary

Answer-population ablation confirmation uses the same exact case/model/repetition pairs, requires
symmetric named-assertion coverage, and applies a paired sign-flip test to per-pair score deltas.
Fewer than six unanimous matched pairs cannot clear the two-sided p≤0.05 floor. The same bound
drives `effect_estimates.py` for with/without lift: its `interval` inverts the sign-flip test, so on
the exact path it cannot exclude zero while `significance` fails to reject, and its `noise_check` reports the moved cases and smallest reachable p that explain why.

`ablation_model.py` closes provenance over `AblationMode`, `Population`, `ComponentClass`, and
`Mechanism`. Strict wire parsers reject unknown strings, booleans masquerading as scalar values,
missing required fields, unsafe/non-slug identifiers, unedited materialized trees, mixed component
populations, and population/component contradictions.
Mode-specific constructors preserve the distinction between materialized, instruction-simulated,
and invalid-skill experiments. `MaterializedArm` still requires a genuinely edited tree and matching
provenance, so a canonical tree cannot be labeled as a materialized removal.

*Note (2026-09-30): `Population` has since been replaced by `manifest_contracts.CasePopulation`, the
one case-population enum, and the lift test and its interval now share one sign-flip core, so they
also agree on the sampled path. Since 2026-10-02 the exact path is chosen on the units that moved,
not the total, and repeated deltas are enumerated as one group.*

## Test proof

The suite uses four complementary proof styles:

- exhaustive state/truth tables for finite lifecycle and verdict combinations;
- model-gap tests that directly attempt contradictory constructors;
- sanitized provider-shaped fixtures at external protocol boundaries; and
- integration tests that feed mismatched models/repetitions, duplicates, missing arms, malformed
  verdicts, incomplete traces, and completed-without-output Jetty records through real consumers.

Cross-boundary reviews also check four composition properties that a local constructor cannot prove:

- identity remains value-based after joins, persistence, and report grouping;
- process/provider/judge/artifact owners preserve facts without synthesizing one another;
- row-to-metric coverage refinement can only remove headline availability; and
- telemetry observation neither grants nor loses grading eligibility.

`ty check` also verifies parser narrowing and exhaustive handling of the trigger result and
cohort sum types. `trigger_reporting.py` joins the repository's expanding typed boundary instead
of relying on a source-shape guard or weakening diagnostics around legacy dictionaries.

Live provider checks remain explicit `--live`; deterministic CI does not require credentials or
network access.

## Residual risks

These constructions make the represented states stronger; they do not invent evidence a provider or
legacy artifact never recorded. In particular:

- legacy rows may lack revision/configuration provenance even when their case/model/run key is
  present; telemetry comparison remains blocked when its required basis is absent;
- Jetty aliases and response shapes still need token-backed live validation before production claims;
- completion evidence exists only where a backend exposes it. Claude records its stop reason and
  served model; Gemini records its served model but an `unobserved` stop; Codex, Vibe,
  `run-subagent`, and Jetty imports record `unobserved` for both (now spelled `unavailable`). On
  every path but Claude's, an answer cut off at an output or turn limit still grades as an
  ordinary miss. *(2026-10-02: `run-subagent` now records the stop and served model too, from
  Claude's stream on its default backend or from `stop_class` and `served_models` in an
  `--agent-cmd` reply; Vibe's stop stays unavailable because its output carries none.)*;
- `RunnerOutcome` is retained as a compatibility factory, so new code should construct the explicit
  union variants directly;
- `skill_benchmark.py` remains a shared orchestration monolith, so the conservative trigger identity
  must invalidate on unrelated edits to that module until trigger ownership is extracted; and
- provider payload dictionaries are preserved for diagnostics, but no downstream decision should
  bypass the typed adapter to read them directly.
